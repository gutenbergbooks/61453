<p class="ph2">PREFACE</p>


<p class="drop">A<span class="uppercase">t</span> the request of numerous friends, but with some hesitation, I
have decided to issue a short account of certain of my experiences
and impressions during a long and delightful association with the
bookselling trade. In doing so, I hope that it may find a welcome with
those members of the trade with whom I have been in happy association
for over sixty years, and that my experience may be a stimulus to those
who are still plodding their way among the many details of what I
consider one of the most interesting and fascinating trades, a trade of
which all the details are never learned.</p>

<p>The bookselling trade has its pleasurable associations as well as its
drawbacks, and, although my early experiences had not great attractions
for me, yet, owing to industry and attention to business, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> much
pleasure in looking back upon what from many points of view may be
considered as a prosperous career.</p>

<p>Personally, I love the making and selling of books, and sincerely hope
that these callings may still have a future far and away greater than
the period through which I have passed.</p>

<p>In addition to "Recollections" of a personal character, I have included
portions of a few articles which I think may interest my readers and
friends. These have appeared at various times, and I hope that they
will now meet with as kindly a reception as they did when they were
first published.</p>

<p>"Sixty Years a Bookman" is intended for three classes of readers&mdash;my
Personal Friends, the Bookselling Trade, and the General Public; and I
trust that there will be found something in these records of a long and
busy life to appeal to them all.</p>

<p class="center">My Early Life in the Country</p>


<p class="drop">I<span class="uppercase">n</span> what is known as the Stroud Valley, Gloucestershire, or, as it was
deservedly called by Queen Victoria, the Golden Valley, stands a little
straggling village called the Thrupp, in which on July 12, 1844, I
was born; but my early recollections of this beautiful valley began
at a village about one mile distant, named Swells Hill, to which my
parents afterwards removed. This village is situated on the side of
the eastern portion of the Cotswolds, a district full of beautiful
hills, gorge-like valleys, dells and glades, celebrated not only for
its beauty and historical associations but for its numerous industries.
Swells Hill overlooks the busy village of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> Brimscombe and is on the
fringe of the delightful Minchinhampton Common, which consists of some
thousand acres of open country; its highest part being about 650 feet
above the sea level; on it, there are many local traditions of great
battles having been fought, and on one particular spot in the centre
of the Common the celebrated George Whitfield preached in 1743 to
thousands of people.</p>

<p>Minchinhampton Common was presented to the parish so named in the reign
of Henry VIII by Dame Alice Hampton. On it are now golf links, which
are well known all over the country and many notable contests have been
played there by some of our most celebrated professionals. From the
quarries on this Common I have often collected fossils of snakes and
other reptiles which I suppose belonged to some prehistoric period,
but how long ago I have been unable to learn. Pit dwellings, long and
round tunnels with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> camps and earthworks, abound in this district.
Some of the depressions in the surface of the Common vary in depth.
I used to be told that they were the burying places of those who had
fought in the days of the Civil Wars. I cannot of course guarantee the
correctness of this statement, but I do know that these depressions
have frequently given me in my school days very much pleasure, as in
the winter they were often filled with snow, and a good run and jump
landed one in the centre of the hollow. It was a great pleasure to see
who could jump the farthest and come out the wettest.</p>

<p>As far as I can remember, most of my early education, or what may be
called my twopenny education, was acquired at an old-fashioned Dame's
School and a local Church School where the main ideas of education were
answering the questions in Pinnock's "Catechism" and learning, and I
must say immediately forgetting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> the questions and answers from the
Church Catechism; but I have no doubt I received impressions which were
useful in after life.</p>

<p>When about nine years of age, I was sent to Amberley School. To reach
this School I had to cross Minchinhampton Common, nearly two miles
from my home; this distance I traversed sometimes four times a day. At
that time home lessons were considered of great importance, but the
weariness of them made a lasting impression upon me. However, it was at
this School that I obtained the best part of my education.</p>

<p>With Amberley I have many associations never to be forgotten. I
remember how when nearing the School I listened for the Master's
whistle which he always appeared in the open to blow, and how
considerate he was with the boys who came from a distance before
marking them late. How on occasions when the hounds on a wintry day
came at full speed past our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> School leave was given to some of us
boys to chase with them. Many a good run I have had following them
over hedges and ditches until outdistanced, but the excitement left
behind very pleasant recollections, and was the cause of my writing the
following verses:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hurrah for To-morrow! 'Tis the first hunting day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And with the good hounds we'll hark hark away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For the Fox will be drawn from the thick bushy wood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">It's the rascal that stole the grey duck's little brood.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You remember the time, 'twas one bright summer morn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When the hens had their chicks and the bees had a swarm,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the duck had her ducklings, and fine ones were they,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As e'er swam on a pond, or play'd pranks in the hay.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Farmer Giles was out early, the sheep had gone wrong,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And old Towler was with him, they scarcely had gone</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When that crafty old Reynard, who had watched them away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Stole the ducks and he had them for dinner that day.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">How he must have enjoyed each tender young bone</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As he scrunched and he scrunched till each tit-bit was gone;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But who would begrudge him a feast in his den,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I dare wager a bet he won't do it again.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For we're off in the morn, while the true scent is strong,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To capture his brush and it won't take us long,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For the horses and hounds are all fit for the fray,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So Ahoy! Tally Ho! Tally Ho! Harkaway!</span><br />
</p>

<p>Close by the Schools stands Rose Cottage where Mrs. Craik, then Miss
Muloch, wrote her most successful novel "John Halifax, Gentleman." This
was published in 1857, the year I was at school, and I have no doubt I
must often have seen Miss Muloch when she was writing her great novel.
The background of this story runs from Tewkesbury through Nailsworth to
Amberley Common; the latter, figuring in the novel as Enderly Flats, is
described as the highest tableland in England. The whole neighbourhood
is identified with incidents delineated in the book, and in Amberley
Churchyard the little blind daughter of John Halifax and Ursula lies at
rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>In the small village of Woodchester, in the valley below Amberley,
there is an important Monastery which contains many interesting
associations, but my recollections are more concerned with the parish
church of Woodchester where I remember being taken by my mother to see
what is left of some old Roman villa with tessellated pavement and
other remains. I believe these are uncovered at certain times and the
public allowed to inspect them.</p>

<p>One other of my youthful enjoyments was the occasional fishing and
bathing in the Thames and Severn Canal. This canal joins together at
Lechlade these two great rivers. In the canal as it passed through the
Golden Valley, there was always a good supply of water and the fishing
here was very good. I never got beyond roach, dace and perch, but there
were frequently pike and other fish caught by the expert. Anyone who
has indulged in fishing, if only as I did in my boyhood, will never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
forget the fascination it has upon the lover of sport, and I pity
the boy who has not the sportive instinct. I learned to swim also in
these waters, but want of opportunity in after years prevented my ever
becoming a really good swimmer.</p>

<p>Looking back upon my boyhood from the standpoint of to-day, I am
inclined to think that, practically, education does not begin until
the first steps are taken in the business of life, although from my
own experience the great influence exercised upon character by a good
mother, which I fortunately had, lasts with a boy and helps to mould
his life and disposition more than he can at the moment anticipate.
I am quite sure that through the early start I made both in the
country and in London, nothing contributed more to my even routine and
carefully considered actions than the influence exercised upon me by a
mother's love.</p>

<p>In September, 1857, I was sent on trial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> before being apprenticed, to
a Mr. Bucknell, a bookseller in George Street, Stroud, and, apparently
proving satisfactory, was afterwards apprenticed for five years, "out
of doors," that is living at home, with the magnificent remuneration of
one shilling per week for the first year, increasing by one shilling
per week at the beginning of the next year, and to be continued upon
the same ratio for five years.</p>

<p>Mr. Bucknell, however, after fifteen months of my apprenticeship sold
the business to Mr. John Clark and I was what is called "turned over"
to him, but the period of my apprenticeship was extended to seven years
and a little more liberal salary given me. When Mr. Bucknell left, he
presented me with a copy of Charles Mackay's poems in which he wrote
the following after my name: "With an earnest wish that his future
life may be deserving of that approval from his fellow-men which he
now receives after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> fifteen months of his apprenticeship from S.G.
Bucknell." Without being in any way conceited, I cannot help feeling
that his good wishes have to a certain extent been fulfilled.</p>

<p>From a quiet village life to the busy town of Stroud was a great
change. My time for work was from eight o'clock in the morning until
eight at night six days of the week, summer and winter, and my only
holidays were Good Friday and Christmas Day. The Bill originating
Bank Holidays had not then been passed. Sometimes during the winter
months the walk home was anything but pleasant, especially as I had to
walk beside the canal for a considerable distance and more than once
had a narrow escape from falling in. It is a truism that familiarity
breeds contempt, and I must admit that this familiarity strengthened
me in what to many would have been a dangerous journey, and it has no
doubt helped me in keeping my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> nerves and my temper from running away
with me. However, all's well that ends well, and although during my
seven years' apprenticeship I had many temptations and dangers, yet I
think I came through them stronger both in mind and body. I remember
that occasionally on my morning walk through some of the lanes to
business, I would meet that sportsman Mr. Paul Hawkins Fisher with his
attendants, each carrying a hawk on his hand, well hooded; sometimes, I
have seen them let fly when they would attack some startled bird, but
I understood they were only training the hawks for future warfare. It
was, however, sportive food for my imagination.</p>

<p>During my years of apprenticeship many events happened, both social
and political, that interested me, and I can only write them down as
my memory helps me and not in any way in the order of their happening.
One of my earliest recollections was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> of an election before vote by
ballot was introduced. The members for the Borough were Edward Horsman
and G. Poulet Scrope, the latter an author of considerable importance.
I remember that, although there was no opposition to the members,
speaking on the hustings, for the nomination, continued until twelve
o'clock, with the intention of nominating Lord John Russell should he
not have been successful in the constituency he was fighting; but he
was successful, so no nomination was necessary. I had occasionally the
pleasure of seeing Lord John Russell, as he lived near Amberley, from
which his eldest son took the title of Viscount Amberley.</p>

<p>Speaking of contests but of another character, it was in 1860 the
fight between Tom Sayers and J.C. Heenan took place. What a tremendous
excitement it produced! I well remember the day after the fight, having
fetched the newspapers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> from the London train and folded them in the
shop, how I stopped every minute to read another line describing the
fight and how angry my master was at my taking so long. But I could
not help it, for the details were quite worth the trouble I brought
upon myself. Some months later I had the pleasure of seeing Sayers box
in connexion with a travelling circus. It was one of the red-letter
days in my life to see the man of whom I had thought so much, showing
his skill as a boxer. It was generally understood that it was at
Stroud that Tom Sayers had his first fight; he was a bricklayer and
was engaged in work at the Stroud Brewery, and falling out with one
of his fellow-workmen, a fight followed which probably led to further
developments. I have also seen his opponent J.C. Heenan boxing in a
circus, but I did not consider him in any way an equal to Tom Sayers.</p>

<p>Although my time was fully occupied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> I was able to enjoy a good game
of cricket with some of my many friends on Rodborough Common. We used
to meet at five o'clock in the morning, and, after a good game, had
breakfast before starting work at eight o'clock. I also joined a class
to learn Latin: there was a dear old gentleman bachelor who loved
literature and education and he took in hand some half-dozen young
fellows to teach them Latin. We used to meet at his house at eight
in the evening for one hour's tuition. I enjoyed it and managed to
master the early chapters of Virgil's "Æneid," and, though I am afraid
the results have not been very great, the little knowledge I obtained
has been useful. I was also much interested in a singing class, over
which a Mr. Helmore, brother to the Rev. T. Helmore, the great Church
choirmaster, presided. We gave performances in the Subscription
Rooms of "The Messiah," "The Creation" and other musical clas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>sics.
I have often thought of the absurdity of one of the choirmaster's
eccentricities when performing "The Creation." Very early in the
oratorio the words are, "And God said let there be light, and there
was light." Before the singing began the lights were turned down and I
was placed near the man who turned on the gas. At the opportune moment
I had to give the signal, the light was turned on and light became a
fact. I have often thought how almost profane it was, but I believe it
passed without any serious protest.</p>

<p>Another yearly event which became fixed in my mind was the appearance
of Dr. Cumming to speak on the coming end of the world. There was a
wealthy lady of Amberley who was a great believer in Dr. Cumming, and
each year he came down and stayed with her and always delivered one
of his unfulfilled prophecies. It was my duty to take the tickets
and see the audience into their seats, but, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> the audience year by
year grew smaller by degrees and beautifully less, this was very easy
work. Like most moderate-sized towns at this period, Stroud had its
Young Men's Institute, of which I was a member, and it was the custom
during the winter to have lectures, etc. I well remember the great
success that always attended the lectures given by George Dawson, a
preacher, lecturer and politician, and George Grossmith, the father of
the well-known actor in Gilbert and Sullivan's plays. These lectures
were usually of a literary or biographical character and undoubtedly
laid the foundations for thought and study in the minds of those who
listened to them.</p>

<p>During my apprenticeship, my master, Mr. John Clark, was sometimes
very exacting, and I know I had to thank Mrs. Clark and some of their
daughters for helping to an extent to ease my work, and for making my
strenuous life run smoothly. Part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> of my work was to learn printing.
This I did, and was able to set up the type of a volume of sermons by a
local vicar. The volume made no reputation, either for the vicar or the
producer of the work.</p>

<p>It was, however, in the buying and selling of books that I was most
interested. These were the great days of the poets, who then had large
sales, Tupper's "Proverbial Philosophy," I think the greatest. What a
change from then to now! I have no doubt that if you asked for this
book to-day in a bookseller's shop no one would know of its existence,
but, without doubt, those of Tupper and other poets were the principal
books given as presents. I remember that Tennyson's "Enoch Arden,"
published by Edward Moxon in 1864, even in such a small town as Stroud
had a large sale. I understand that 50,000 copies of this book were
sold during the first year of its publication.</p>

<p>There is one thing I was greatly blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> with&mdash;a good memory; and
I can safely say I knew every book in our stock. When a traveller
came round for orders, I was always stationed near my master and the
traveller and if an order was being given I had to say whether the book
was in stock or not. Those were also the days when booksellers sold
patent medicines, in which a large trade was done; especially with
such articles as Holloway's, Morrison's, and other pills, with various
preparations to cure every disease under the sun.</p>

<p>In looking back to those times, I have often dwelt upon the thought
whether it is best for youths to be brought up under severe discipline
or under easy surroundings and have come to the conclusion that the
happy medium is most desirable, for in my own case and although my
master Mr. Clark was a straightforward honourable man, he was not a man
who sympathized with labour, but looked upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> it as something one had
to put up with; but where a man is just and honourable as he was this
influence is for good, and labour is made more pleasant and agreeable.
I have much to thank Mr. Clark for, especially in the directions
mentioned, and always feel that the thoroughness of his business habits
had a lasting effect upon me. I can look back upon my seven years'
apprenticeship with much thankfulness, not only for my personal good
health but the many pleasant associations with which I was surrounded.</p>

<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></p>

<p class="center">My Early London Experiences</p>


<p class="drop">I<span class="uppercase">n</span> September, 1864, I came to London, although not for the first time,
as I had made two visits to the metropolis before this important event
in my life. On one of these occasions I well remember sitting on an
omnibus which came down from Snow Hill and at the bottom of the hill a
horse was switched on to the front of the 'bus to pull it up Holborn
Hill which was then paved with rugged stones. Even with three horses,
they had to pull from one side to the other in their effort to reach
the top. This dip is now bridged over by the Holborn Viaduct, which I
remember seeing Queen Victoria declare open in 1872. The other occasion
was to visit the Ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>hibition of 1862. It was a great revelation and
interested me much.</p>

<p>Before coming to my situation in London, I had quite made up my mind
that I would see anything there was to be seen that was within my reach
and means. I think one of the earliest events which happened was the
hanging at Newgate of Muller, who murdered a Mr. Briggs whilst riding
in a train from Liverpool Street to Bow. He committed the murder and
managed to escape to America, but was deported, tried and condemned to
be hung. In those days the gallows was erected in the Old Bailey, the
night before the execution, and the condemned was brought out through
the prison door in the Old Bailey and mounted steps to the scaffold,
with Calcraft the hangman walking beside him. In this way you obtained
a good view of the culprit. I arrived at the Old Bailey at five in the
morning so had a long wait until eight, the time of the execution, but
the talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> and byplay helped to pass the time. I had a good view of
the terrible ordeal and came away with some new experiences, one of
which was that I lost in the crowd a very dainty scarf pin which had
been given to me on leaving Stroud. This taught me the advisability of
leaving my valuables at home when going into crowds.</p>

<p>I had now settled down at Islington, which was just one mile from the
General Post Office and when leaving home too near 8.30, which was the
time for getting to business, I could take a cab with a friend for this
distance. It cost us sixpence, threepence each for one mile; but cab
fares, like many other things, have changed since then.</p>

<p>Before coming to London, I had never been inside a theatre. My first
experience was at Sadlers Wells Theatre, where a Miss Marriott was
playing "Hamlet." My interest and enthusiasm in that play has from
that time never ceased. I went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> see it on Monday, on Tuesday, and
on Wednesday, and if funds had allowed my inclination would have
continued for the rest of the week. "Hamlet" made a greater impression
on me than any sermon I ever heard. I learned a great deal of the play
by heart, and, although I have seen "Hamlet" played many times since,
it never impressed me so much as it did on that occasion at Sadlers
Wells. This theatre was opened in 1844 and for some twenty years
Samuel Phelps was associated with it, his aim being to produce all
Shakespeare's plays, but he only succeeded in producing thirty-four of
them. Phelps was a great tragedian, and I have often seen him acting
at Drury Lane Theatre. From very early in my youth I have been a lover
of Shakespeare, and this was mainly brought about through one of my
sisters joining with me in taking Cassell's edition in seven-penny
monthly numbers, which we both read as they were issued. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
published in three volumes and I have the copy now bound in calf. Like
many others of my books, they have to me a speaking remembrance.</p>

<p>It was in 1867 that a new and interesting experience came my way. For
many years various associations had held meetings in Hyde Park to air
their grievances, either imaginary or otherwise. At one of these, the
Home Secretary, Spencer H. Walpole, decided that a different method
should be adopted in their management. This was objected to by a
particular Association and they defied the Home Secretary, with the
result that he had the gates of the Park closed against them. The
people were so incensed at this that although the railings of the
Park were as far as possible protected by the police, the crowds were
too strong for them and broke the railings in many places and held
their meeting. I was among those who helped to pull down the railings
and got for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> trouble a good blow on my back from a policeman's
truncheon. However, I had an experience which was new and interesting:
I cannot say who was in the right, but I remember the Home Secretary
had to resign a few days afterwards for what was stated to be lack of
tactfulness in regard to this meeting.</p>

<p>One of the most sickening and disgusting sights which I remember
was the old slaughter-houses of Smithfield. This Market stood where
Paternoster Square now stands. Cattle were driven into the market
during the night, bullocks and sheep, and were killed in the early
morning and sometimes during the day. I have watched them being
slaughtered and seen the blood flow from the slaughter-houses into
Paternoster Row. To people of to-day it does not seem possible that
such a thing could be allowed in the heart of the City of London. The
butchers would often parade round their shops with what was called
a Cleaver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> Chorus; this was done by bringing together with a clash
a marrow-bone and their cleaver or hatchet, and quite an attractive
sound was produced but not much harmony. When there was an execution
taking place at Newgate, these men would gather together in a body in
their disgusting blood-soaked overalls and just before the time for
the execution rush singing into the crowd surrounding the gallows.
However thick the crowd was, the people would give way rather than come
into contact with these greasy and disgusting butchers, who by these
means got a front position in what should have been a sad and mournful
ceremony.</p>

<p>It was probably through there being so much more meat near at hand
that the prices for lunch were much cheaper then than they are now. I
remember in Warwick Lane there used to be a popular refreshment house
called "The Bedford," and many times I have had a good lunch there for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
sixpence, a lunch which consisted of toad-in-the-hole (it was made
of a good beef-steak in the middle of batter pudding) for fourpence,
potatoes one penny, and ale one penny. Things have changed greatly
since those times. There also used to be in the Oxford Arms passage,
situated where some of the St. Paul's residentiary houses now stand, an
inn, in association with the hay market held there, named the Oxford
Arms. Here each day there was brought on to the table a good joint of
beef or a leg of mutton from which you could cut and come again, with
vegetables, pastry, etc., all for the price of one shilling. For the
sake of many in the City, one is often tempted to wish some of these
old customs were with us still.</p>

<p>I have a lingering remembrance of an important event occurring just
before bedtime in December, 1867. A fire was evident somewhere at the
West End, so off I started and was in time to see the last of Her
Majesty's Theatre which was that night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> entirely burned down. It was a
grand sight, but the crowd which collected was unbearable. I understood
that at the time an opera was being played and several of the great
performers of the day, such as Titiens, Christine Neilson, and Santley,
were among the artistes present. It was a sight never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Adah Isaacs Menken, an American actress
and poet and also the wife of J.C. Heenan, the prize fighter, was
playing the hero in "Mazeppa" at Astley's Theatre. She was a splendid
and attractive figure, and when she came on the stage, dressed only in
tights, mounting her horse and riding away into the wilds to be picked
to pieces by the birds, she had a tremendous ovation. The performance
was a great attraction and most young men made a point of seeing it. It
was said that a bet had been made as to whether the actress's legs were
padded and the attendant who helped her on to the horse was bribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> to
pinch her leg to settle the bet. I heard that he did so, and got a kick
in return which not only settled the bet but also the attendant.</p>

<p>The changes that have been made in London since my early days have
been very great. I never pass down Holborn but I think of the passage
called Middle Row, which I have often gone through, in front of the
delightful old-fashioned Shakespearean houses of which we are all so
proud. At that time there was a row of houses on the other side of the
passage, and at nearly the bottom of the hill stood the publishing
house of Darton &amp; Harvey. This, like many others, has been swept away
by the present Holborn Viaduct. The Thames Embankment was opened within
my early recollection, also the Law Courts; and there was also the
sweeping away of Holywell Street, where I have passed many a pleasant
hour poring over the boxes of old books in search of a treasure. I
remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> once, as I thought, buying for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a book with not
a very chaste reputation. It was done up very carefully in a sealed
envelope and when I opened it at home I found it was an old soiled
Common Prayer Book. I did not get what I expected, but perhaps it was
better for me that I was swindled. London, however, is being made a
city of which we are all proud. Although there is still much to be
done, the changes and improvements have been great since my early days.</p>

<p>Going back to the Theatre and Music Hall, these were the times of the
songs "Champagne Charlie is my name," sung by Leybourne, "The Bells
go a Ringing for Sarah," by Kate Santley, Stead's "The Perfect Cure,"
and, from a different point of view, the delightful singing by Sims
Reeves of "Come into the Garden, Maud," and Carlotta Patti of "Home,
Sweet Home," and "Comin' through the Rye." These now appear very
old-fashioned, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> touched the imagination more than many of the
songs of the present day. Blondin was at this time at the height of
his popularity. His performances at the Crystal Palace, and afterwards
at the Alexandra Palace and other places, attracted great crowds. It
made you hold your breath to watch him on the high rope balancing a
four-legged chair and then stand upon it, or sometimes carry a man on
his back across the rope or wheel him in a barrow.</p>

<p>Among other exhibitions, I remember seeing General Tom Thumb and Minnie
Warren with their troop of midget humanity, performing at St. James's
Hall. Cremorne Gardens and Highbury Barn were at this time at the
height of their popularity, and although from where I lived it meant a
night out to visit the former, the latter was within walking distance.
I wanted to see everything possible, and I think so far I succeeded,
for my wanderings were varied from the top of St. Paul's Cathedral and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the Monument to the Cider Cellars in the Strand and to Nicholson's
Judge and Jury and the Poesie Plastics of Leicester Square.</p>

<p>Living as I did at this time in the north of London, I frequently
walked through Highbury to what is now the beautiful Finsbury Park. The
New River was then an open stream beside which it was pleasant to walk.
On passing through a wicket-gate, one came to a building called the
Sluice House, at which refreshments could be procured. A path through
a field took us to Finsbury Park Tavern on the site of which the
refreshment houses in Finsbury Park now stand. Boats were let out for
hire on the lake, and pigeon shooting was one of the sports carried on
in the grounds. Many times have I seen a considerable number of these
injured innocents brought down. This sport, I am pleased to think, is
not so popular now as it was at that period.</p>

<p>It was, I suppose, somewhat natural to a young man who has been brought
up in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> very puritanical atmosphere and among the strictest sect
of the Pharisees, to take every advantage of the liberty I was now
enjoying. I was anxious, however, to see and hear some of the preachers
of whom I had heard so much. This attraction, however, soon died away,
because to an extent I found no sympathy. The first great preacher I
went to hear was the Rev. C.H. Spurgeon. Unfortunately my impression
of him was a bad one, for he had just given out his text when several
people walked into the chapel. The preacher stopped and looked hard
at the people entering. When they were seated, he said, "We are sorry
we could not wait for you, but you will be in time to go away with
the rest." I thought this a most unkind and uncalled-for remark, and
made up my mind I would never hear him again, and I did not. Another
incident, I suppose I must call it, or eccentricity, occurred at the
only time I heard Dr. Parker at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> City Temple. Before beginning his
sermon he waited a few minutes and then said, "We are not feeling quite
well this evening, so shall dispense with our usual action." To me,
this was nothing but unnecessary egotism.</p>

<p>The one man to whom I always enjoyed listening was the Rev. J.C.M.
Bellew, who preached in Bloomsbury. He was a great elocutionist, his
sermons were well constructed and interesting, and to me the music was
the greatest charm of all. The most eloquent and informing sermon I
ever heard was one by Canon Liddon, in St. Paul's Cathedral, on Buddha.
He preached for one hour and a quarter, and never did I experience
quicker or more intellectual enjoyment than on that occasion. I also
had the pleasure of hearing, at Islington, Professor Huxley deliver one
of his controversial addresses. Huxley's life was principally spent in
the promulgating of right and truth, and his eloquence was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> almost an
inspiration. The only time I had the pleasure of hearing John Bright
speak was at the Highbury Congregational Church, when he presided at a
lecture given by the Rev. R.W. Dale. A more eloquent introduction than
that given by John Bright I have never heard.</p>

<p>Sport was always one of my fascinations, whether it was running,
walking, boxing, or cricket. I have no doubt the cricket I so much
enjoyed during my apprenticeship helped me in obtaining a position in
the eleven at Stationers' Hall Court, where for many years a good team
was always available for a Saturday afternoon game; and I am pleased
to record that in these early days there were few things I looked
forward to with greater pleasure than the Saturday afternoon cricket,
especially when I was chosen as one of the eleven.</p>

<p>One Saturday afternoon an extraordinary incident took place at a
cricket match, at which I was a spectator; it was between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> Middlesex
and Nottingham, on the ground now held by the Smithfield Market near
Holloway. Tom Hearn, the great Middlesex bowler, was holding the ball
ready for delivery, when a pigeon came flying over the wicket. Hearn
looked up and in a moment threw the ball into the air and struck the
pigeon in the breast. The poor bird fluttered down close to the wicket.
It was a clever shot and Hearn was greatly cheered.</p>

<p>Occasionally during the week, boxing was one of my great delights, and
I flatter myself I was quite up to the average in this most useful
exercise. I have seen most of the champion boxers of that period
engaged in the noble art of self-defence, and on one occasion I was
persuaded to have the gloves on with a professional prize fighter, but
my weak points were soon found out, and I felt it was best to leave
well alone.</p>

<p>What greatly interested me on one occa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>sion was my visit to a ratting
match. The wager was laid on a terrier for £25 that he would kill 300
rats in fifteen minutes. The rats were taken out of traps and counted
into a square pit, and as they fell in they rushed to one corner of it.
When the 300 were all in, it was a wonderful sight to see them in a
heap in one corner of the pit. The dog, Peter was his name, was put in
the middle of the pit and when the referee called time, he was let go
and the killing began with a vengeance. The bet was won with a minute
to spare, and I can safely say I never spent fourteen minutes amid
greater tension and excitement.</p>

<p>In these times, on Good Friday, there was always wrestling at the
Agricultural Hall. I usually went and well remember the splendid
contest between the Cornish and Cumberland wrestlers. It was great
sport, and for a few minutes during the surging back and forward before
a firm grip had been obtained by one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> giants, the spectators
almost held their breath in the excitement. I often wonder whether
this particular sport of wrestling has, like many other things, become
almost a thing of the past, or is it that our lives have so changed
that we now take little notice of such matters.</p>

<p>Although somewhat indirectly connected with sport, I have always
derived a great deal of fun and enjoyment from watching the return of
the visitors of the Epsom Races to see the Derby run. From Clapham
Common to the Elephant and Castle, and on to the City there was for
many hours one continuous stream of people and conveyances, some
in good style, while others rode in donkey carts or any conveyance
obtainable. These race-goers mostly sang comic songs, were all bent
upon enjoyment, and in many cases the race appeared to be a secondary
consideration. These enjoyments have now mostly passed away, a better
tone prevails with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> people, and the means of conveyance to Epsom
Downs have been greatly accelerated. I once had the pleasure of seeing
the Derby ran; it was in 1896, when the race was won by Persimmon, King
Edward VII's (then Prince of Wales) horse. It was a splendid race, and
never could there have been a greater reception than was given when the
Prince came from the Stand after the race to lead his horse back to the
weighing machine.</p>

<p>My experience on that occasion must have been almost a record. I left
business at one o'clock, went by cab to London Bridge, caught a train
to Epsom, arrived at my arranged stand on the race-course, and saw each
race run until the Derby was over and the Prince had led his horse off
the course; then to the station and back to town and was in business
again at four o'clock&mdash;in all, three hours. This was a good record.</p>

<p>During the summer, with a small band<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> of fellow-assistants, I often
arranged pedestrian outings. We frequently started early on Saturday,
after business, slept the night out and returned by train on Sunday
evening. Two of these outings are still fresh in my memory. On the
first occasion, we went by train to Gravesend, then walked to Chatham,
where we spent a very uncomfortable night, thence to Rochester
Cathedral and the Dickens country, afterwards walking to St. Mary's
Cray and staying on the way to inspect Kit's Coty House in Kent, a
prehistoric structure which belongs to the Stone or Bronze Age. It
consists of a large flat stone supported by two other stones and is
a link with the past and well worth a visit. From St. Mary's Cray we
reached home by train.</p>

<p>Another of our outings was by rail to Hampton Court, then a walk to
Staines, where we had to sleep on the floor and on billiard tables,
but, not being very com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>fortable, we got up at three o'clock in the
morning and spent our time, until breakfast was ready, rowing on the
Thames. From Staines we walked to Windsor, and were in time for service
at St. George's Chapel, and I had the pleasure of hearing the then
Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Tait; thence home by train. Such outings
as these can only be enjoyed at one period of life, and I have always
been glad I undertook them when I did, for other things came into my
life which made me, I hope, a better and happier man.</p>

<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></p>

<p class="center">Some Recollections of Stationers' Hall Court</p>


<p class="drop">A<span class="uppercase">lthough</span> I have referred in another chapter to my early association
with bookselling, yet it was not until my entry into the employ
of Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co., on September 23, 1864, that my real
bookselling experience commenced. This may not be quite in accord with
the title I have chosen of "Sixty Years a Bookman," but, as previously
stated, I served seven years' apprenticeship to a bookseller before
entering the firm of Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co., and these two periods
extend beyond that implied by the title of this book.</p>

<p>As long as my memory lasts, I shall never forget the first few weeks of
my experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> in this firm, from 8.30 in the morning until the work
was finished. Up and down stairs and ladders searching for books made
one so tired that sometimes I could scarcely crawl to my home. Even to
this I soon became accustomed, and the tiredness to an extent, so far
as my body was concerned, became a thing of the past; but it will never
be effaced from my memory.</p>

<p>These were also the times when the principal day of the month was
Magazine day, and after the ordinary business hours were over every
one stopped to put together each customer's magazines. I quite think
that if there were not then a greater number of different magazines
published, they had, certainly as far as this firm was concerned, a
much larger sale. Anyway, it was a day that one felt thankful to see
finished. At this period late hours were considered inevitable, for
during the winter season it was frequently ten o'clock before we got
away, while some assistants in the firm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> in other book firms at
certain times worked until after twelve o'clock at night. I remember,
when speaking of this to a fellow-assistant, being told that this
was nothing to what it had been formerly: a short Saturday afternoon
and no Bank Holiday, and occasionally some of the people would only
see their homes three times during the week; they had to sleep on or
under the counters. Fortunately, all these absurd arrangements are now
ancient history and never again likely to be a part of what is called
civilization or business methods.</p>

<p>I well remember my first holiday, if it can be so called. It was the
Christmas following the September of my entering Simpkins. I wanted to
spend it at Weston-super-Mare, and as Christmas came on Sunday, Monday
was given as a holiday. I caught a G.W.R. train about ten o'clock on
the Saturday evening. There was only a single line then to Weston,
from a junction on the main line at which we stopped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> From here, in a
single railroad carriage with a white horse attached to it, we jogged
for many miles and arrived at our destination at six in the morning.</p>

<p>My friends were waiting for me, and we had a jolly Christmas. I started
back by a midnight train on Monday, arriving in London at seven on
the Tuesday morning. I had some breakfast and then went to business
until nine o'clock at night. This was what was then called a Christmas
holiday. But with all this, I can bear testimony to the kindness and
consideration shown to the assistants by the partners of this period in
the firm of Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co., especially Messrs. John, Frederick
and William Miles; and as far as I am personally concerned, I shall
always remember with a thankful heart the courtesy and consideration I
received from them.</p>

<p>These were the times of Old Moore's and Hannay's Almanacs, the
publishing day of the former being a great occasion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> At this time
it was published by the Stationers' Company, as nearly as possible
on November 21, at twelve o'clock. On the day of publication the
Hall doors were opened, and the porter who first got through with a
sack-load of almanacs received a gift of, I think, five shillings.
There were always a number of people to watch this publishing event,
and the winner was greatly cheered.</p>

<p>At this time "Hannay's Almanac" also had a large sale, but it only
survived a few years after the first issue of the greatly renowned
"Whitaker's Almanack," now over fifty years old. This almanac
deserves the success it has secured. No business or even private
intelligence department can afford to be without it; it practically
has no competitor, and the knowledge it contains might well be termed
universal and encyclopædic.</p>

<p>While speaking of Stationers' Hall and Stationers' Court, I will try
to remove an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> impression which suggests that the word Stationers
originated from the locality in bygone times being connected with the
paper trade. This is not so; but being so near St. Paul's Cathedral, it
was one of the <i>stations</i> at which vendors of crosses and other wares
for religious observances had their stands or shops for the sale of
these articles; hence its origin. The following streets also derived
their names through being near or associated with St. Paul's Cathedral:
Paternoster Row, Creed Lane, Ave Maria Lane and Graces Court. In Ivy
Lane dwelt the wax-chandlers who in bygone times supplied tapers for
lighting the Cathedral.</p>

<p>I cannot say if religion at this period had a passion for more
excitement than at the present time, but undoubtedly there were more
books of that character sold than there are to-day. What immense sales
such books as the following had: Hall's "Come to Jesus," "Heaven Our
Home,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> "The Sinner's Friend," "Across the River," Beecher's "Life
Thoughts," "The Pathway of Promise," "Able to Save," Baynes' "Lyra
Anglicana," "Christ is Coming," "Letters from Hell," "The Gates Ajar,"
Oxenden's "Pathway of Safety," "The Heavenly Home," or the "Employment
and Enjoyment of the Saints in Heaven," with works by Dr. Guthrie,
Richard Weaver, Dr. Vaughan, A.K.H.B., Dr. Winslow, and books on the
coming end of the world by Dr. Cummings. In fact, one of the leading
journals of this time discussed the question as to what devotional
books were most popular, and the answer given was, "Not the 'Imitation
of Christ,'" but works telling the Christian how to make the best
of both worlds, and describing heaven as minutely as if it were a
first-class hotel, where every pleasure is provided for the elect.
Judging from the titles this would appear correct, but fortunately this
class of book has almost ceased to be, and works of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> a more reasonable
and literary character have taken their place.</p>

<p>Some years ago I wrote an article bearing upon this subject, and as I
feel that the words are as true to-day as when written, I here produce
portions from the article which deals more fully with this question.</p>

<p>It must be apparent to anyone glancing through the publishers' lists
of the books now being issued, and comparing them with the lists
of fifty years ago, that a great decline has taken place in the
production of religious books. This decline is observable not only in
the old-fashioned religious publications which were looked upon as
belonging to the classics, but also in the more modern productions of
a like character. These latter sold by their thousands, but the demand
for both appears at the present to have nearly passed away, and their
sale is now of the most limited description.</p>

<p>In an attempt to account for this decline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> more or less plausible
reasons have been adduced, but the most forcible, perhaps, is, that
just now there is no religious wave passing over the country, nor are
there any great ecclesiastics who have time or who consider it part
of their duty to be continually issuing books on purely religious
subjects. Add to this the fact that trade frequently runs in cycles,
with the effect that the depression in this particular class of
literature is just now at its lowest point. When this is so, something
often occurs to bring it back again to its normal condition, and this
may prove to be the case in the production and sale of religious books.</p>

<p>A potent factor in this depression is undoubtedly the growth of
independent thought, which was such a marked characteristic in the
latter part of the nineteenth century. The influence of Puritanism,
which so deeply affected English life, and which in past ages permeated
the action and thought of this country, has now nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> spent itself,
so the sale of old Puritan books has almost ceased. During that period
the noblest characters were moulded from those appearing in the Bible;
these are now shaped more by education and culture. Whether this will
be to the advantage of the nation, must be left for a future generation
to decide.</p>

<p>There is much truth in the remark that the literature of a nation
largely indicates the disposition of its people; but this observation
scarcely applies to the religious side of our national life, for,
although there has been a great decline in the issue of religious
books, the activity of nearly all sections of the Christian Church
during the same period has been most marked. The result of this is
the establishment by the various religious denominations of special
publishing departments for their own particular class of religious
works. They have also weekly and monthly periodicals which circulate
amongst their own people and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> through their own channels; and although
these with their books do not in all cases come through the ordinary
distributing agencies, and are not always recorded in the return of
books issued during the year, yet, even taking all this into account,
there is undoubtedly a great decline in the issue of religious works.</p>

<p>For some years previous to this period many of our religious writers
were at the height of their popularity and their books were having
immense sales. Much of this success was due to the writers' influence
in the pulpit. Among the most prominent was the Rev. J.R. Macduff,
whose first and best known book, and the one that had the longest
vitality, was "The Faithful Promiser." Originally written with the
intention of being sent only to his old friends as a memento of his
connexion with the parish he had just left, it found favour with a
much larger public who eagerly purchased edition after edition until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
hundreds of thousands of copies were sold. Next in popularity was his
"Morning and Night Watches," which also had an enormous sale, and his
"Memories of Bethany," the sale of which ran into many thousands. All
the books of this author were more or less successful (and he was a
most voluminous writer), but the sale of the majority has now very
greatly decreased, while some are seldom, if ever, inquired for.</p>

<p>Dean Goulburn's "Thoughts on Personal Religion" was once to be found
in every bookseller's shop throughout the kingdom, and at the height
of its popularity had an annual sale of nearly ten thousand copies;
now its circulation is of a very limited character. This was one of
the books which Mr. Gladstone generally gave to the young men who were
fortunate enough to come within his sphere of influence.</p>

<p>Another author whose books were formerly very popular was Bishop
Oxenden. The one which had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> biggest sale was "The Pathway of
Safety," but most of his works sold by their tens of thousands. Mention
should also be made of those by the Rev. Horatius Bonar, especially his
"Hymns of Faith and Hope," each volume as it appeared passing through
many editions.</p>

<p>The following names will bring back to many readers the titles of books
which have been appreciated by young as well as old: the Rev. John
Angell James, the Rev. Newman Hall (over a million of the latter's
"Come to Jesus" have been disposed of), Miss Havergal, Miss Marsh, the
Rev. James Hamilton, the Rev. W. Jay, and the Rev. C.H. Spurgeon. These
names represent a few only out of the many writers of religious books
which were then popular. Most of them have greatly decreased sales,
while others have fallen out altogether and are probably quite unknown
to the present generation. There were also issued about this time many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
religious works published anonymously. These caused a great stir,
and met with an extensive demand. Amongst them were "Able to Save,"
"Pathway of Promise," "Meet for Heaven," "Throne of Grace," "Heaven our
Home," but, like the works already noticed, they have also run their
course.</p>

<p>The first half of the Victorian era was apparently the Golden Age for
religious books, for besides those writers who issued their books
independently there was at this period a large number of separate
series and libraries in vogue which contained reissues of most of the
leading works by the old divines.</p>

<p>To show the variety and range of these issues, a selected few
might here be mentioned. The most important amongst them were "The
Christian's Family Library." This was under the editorship of the Rev.
Edward Bickersteth, and consisted of about fifty-two volumes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> all of
a theological character. Another was the "Biblical Cabinet," issued by
Clark, of Edinburgh, in forty-six volumes. The "Lady's Closet Library"
contained volumes on "The Marys," "The Marthas," "The Lydias," "The
Hannahs," etc., of Scripture; "The Christian's Fireside Library," in
which were such books as Bigg's "Handbook of Popery" and McIlvaine's
"Evidences of Christianity"; "The Library of Christian Biography,"
edited by Rev. Robert Bickersteth, was another important series,
whose general title indicates the class of literature it contained.
Under the editorship of such well-known men as Dr. Pye Smith, Robert
Southey, and James Montgomery, a series of "Sacred Classics" were very
popular: so also was "The London Theological Library," containing such
representative works as Lardner's "Credibility of Gospel History" and
Milner's "Church of Christ."</p>

<p>The following titles of a few series out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> of many may be of interest:
"Protestant's Sound Literature," "Pickering's Christian Classics,"
"Library of Puritan Divines," "The Sacred Family Library," "The
Spiritual Library," and "The Practical Christian's Library." In
most of these libraries there appeared an edition of some of these
old-fashioned and now almost obsolete religious books represented by
the following titles: Boston's "Crook in the Lot," Sutton's "Learning
to Live, and Learning to Die," Ken's "Divine Love," Taylor's "Holy
Living and Dying," Watson's "Apology," Baxter's "Saints' Rest," Magee
on "The Atonement," Paley's "Evidences," and Law's "Serious Call."
Most of these have now a very flickering existence, while for others
there is no market whatever. How truly the wise and eloquent words of
Bishop Carpenter in his Hulsean Lectures illustrate the reputation and
influence of many of the writers of religious books, both ancient and
modern, and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> books themselves, some of these having a vitality
only during their authors' lives, while others, like their writers,
shed influence through succeeding generations. The Bishop says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"She [History] measures men not by the tawdry reputations of the hour,
but by the influence they can diffuse; she watches the circling wave
which forms as men cast their force into the great ocean of life, and
she measures their power by the life of that wave; and she finds that
few&mdash;few indeed&mdash;have been able to spread their influences beyond
their age; she notes many exalted to the skies, and she sees that in
the next generation their name is clean put out; she measures the
greatness of men as men do the height of mountains, by the length of
the shadows they cast upon the surface of the world; and, measuring
thus, she bids those whose influence lives through the ages to sit
like gods among the hills of time."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is intended here to consider only those works or writers which
were of a popular character. It would therefore be out of place to
record the various volumes of sermons, biographies, or theological
treatises on the various systems which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> have more or less occupied the
attention of the religious world, and have to a large extent shaped the
character of many of our denominations. In passing, however, it may be
of interest to direct attention to that vast array of literature which
sprang into existence through the religious controversies which have to
a large extent influenced the English Church.</p>

<p>The greatest of these was that known as the Tractarian Movement, and
centred round the illustrious names of Keble, Newman, and Pusey. An
extensive library might be formed of the works brought forth by this
polemic controversy. The publication of "Essays and Reviews," Seeley's
"Ecce Homo," Gladstone's "Vatican Decrees," and "Lux Mundi," edited
by Canon Gore, also produced a flood of literature which has left an
indelible mark on religious thought and practice. To these may probably
be traced that diffusion of religious influence which has entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> into
so many branches of our literature and even to our fiction.</p>

<p>Another branch of religious literature which shows a conspicuous
decline is that of "Family Prayers." Years ago, no bookseller's
shop would be complete without a copy of Oxenden's, Bickersteth's,
Villiers', or Thornton's "Family Prayers"; and such old-fashioned
volumes as Hawker's "Daily Portion," "The New Week's Preparation,"
Jenk's "Devotions," Fletcher's "Family Devotion," and the "Family
Prayers" of Toplady and Reven, were all in constant demand. With
these are associated a number of volumes of private devotion, Bishop
Wilson's "Sacra Privata" and "Pietas Quotidiana" being the most
popular. These, like the "Family Prayers," show a great decline both
in their production and sale. It is difficult to suggest a reason for
this decline other than that of the general evolution in religious
thought which is continually changing the course of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> progress
and action. Religion is undoubtedly the greatest factor in influencing
the character of a nation, so from this foundation there will probably
spring up in the future a broad, reasonable, and intelligent class
of writings which in their development and thought will be more
cosmopolitan than doctrinal, and which will deserve to be classed as
English literature.</p>

<p>In comparing the educational literature of this period the changes have
also been very great; those were the days when the works edited by Dr.
Smith took the lead in the higher branches of education. Colenso's
Arithmetic was the most popular book on that subject, while Cornwell's
Geography and his other books were great sellers. The "Child's Guide
to Knowledge" sold in its thousands, Chambers's educational books
were very popular, as were also Brewer's Guides, "Stepping Stones to
Knowledge," Weale's Series, Pinnock's, Guy's, and Wilson's Catechisms
and Gleig's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> School Series. Of not quite the same character but
greatly used for educational purposes were "Line upon Line" and "Peep
of Day." Of the latter, some 250,000 copies were sold in the early
days of its publication. Spelling books were then a most important
part of educational literature, the most popular being Butter's, but
the following also had large sales, Guy's, Mavor's and Vyse's. The
copyright of Vyse's sold for £2,500, with an annuity to the author of
£50 per year. The change in this class of educational literature has
been very great.</p>

<p>It was in 1864 that the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge
announced that their books could now be obtained by booksellers on
favourable terms. This was also the first year of the publication of
"The Statesman's Year Book," which has had a continuous, and I hope
will have a lasting, success. There were also many libraries which
had large sales and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> very popular. Among them were Hurst and
Blackett's, Bentley's Standard Library, Select Library of Fiction,
Run and Read Library, Railway Library, Parlour Library, Travellers'
Library, Home and Colonial Library, Bohn's Various Libraries, The
Cottage Library, consisting of some 300 volumes, Lardner's Scientific
Library, and Beale's Sixpenny Library. Most of our older poets had at
this period very large sales; but, like other things, there has been a
great change in poetry, not only in the style of writing but also in
the ideals, which are more lofty and inspiring and are far above such
writers as Cowper, Longfellow, Moore, Tupper and others who at this
period were very popular.</p>

<p>About this time the following Magazines were started, and they all had
a considerable popularity and very large sales, but, strangely enough,
they have now all ceased to exist: "The Sunday Magazine," of which over
one hundred thousand of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> first number was sold, "Good Words," also
selling largely, "The Argosy," "Aunt Judy's Magazine," "Belgravia,"
"London Society," "Tinsley's Magazine," edited by Anthony Trollope, and
"The Broadway." Number one had a sale of over 100,000 copies.</p>

<p>In 1865 "The Fortnightly Review" was started under the editorship of
G.H. Lewes. From that time onward it has maintained a reputation for
scholarly, intellectual and scientific articles and is always up to
date upon all subjects of the day.</p>

<p>In looking back, it is interesting to note the change in the character
of book illustrations. Formerly, especially at Christmas time, there
was a large output of well-illustrated books, principally in black and
white, and there were then few illustrations printed in colour. The
illustrations of Gustave Doré must take the first place as commanding
the greatest public attention. Among other popular illustrators of this
period were John Tenniel, Birket Foster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> Selous, T. Leighton, G.J.
Pinwell, Noel Humphreys, J.E. Millais, John Gilbert, Arthur Hughes,
Kate Greenaway, Richard Doyle, A.B. Houghton, Sidney Cooper, and the
brothers Dalziel, who were also great producers of the printing blocks.</p>

<p>Another of the leading features of the trade was the immense sale
of Birthday Books, from Shakespeare to Tennyson. Every poet with a
reputation had a compilation made from his writings for which there
was always a receptive public. One of the most fascinating and lasting
of juvenile books popular at this time was "Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland." The larger part of the first edition of this book was sold
to an American publisher so that a second edition could be quickly
announced; that was probably a wise policy and helped to draw attention
to the value of the book.</p>

<p>During this and the following years, many authors had great reputations
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> to-day have almost ceased. The books of most of them have
long been out of print, and are almost forgotten except by those who
lived during the middle of the nineteenth century. I would instance
"A.L.O.E.," who had some fifty books in circulation, the author of
"Mary Powell," who issued some twenty-four popular stories, the Rev.
J.C. Ryle, Hugh Miller, Mrs. Webb, William and Mary Howitt, Artemus
Ward, Mrs. Sewell, R.M. Ballantyne, Samuel Smiles, Miss Yonge, James
Grant, Mayne Reid, John Timbs, S. Baring-Gould, Mrs. Carey Brock,
Mrs. Gatty, and many others. Some of the novelists who have come to
stay had at this period very large sales. Among them, of course, were
Dickens, Thackeray, Scott, C. Kingsley, Miss Braddon, Anthony Trollope,
George Eliot, and others who, I think, laid a foundation which was very
helpful to our later novelists; but it is quite a question whether a
new departure is not now developing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> that the novel of to-day deals
more particularly with the practical events of everyday life and the
effect they have upon the moral and spiritual development of the nation.</p>

<p>When Paternoster Square took the place of Newgate Market in 1872, it
was quite anticipated that this position would be occupied entirely
by publishers and thus form a centre for the trade, but at present
this hope has not been realized. During these years great changes took
place in Paternoster Row, many of the old buildings giving place to
new ones of greater architectural beauty. The following houses are
at the present time examples of the improvements which took place by
rebuilding: Longmans, Blackwoods, Nelsons, Aldine Chambers. Other
changes and improvements are in progress to-day. The Oxford University
Press took over the business of the Oxford Bible Warehouse, with what
success may be judged by its palatial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> buildings and business in Amen
Corner and Ave Maria Lane, to which it moved in 1883.</p>

<p>There has also been a great change in books besides those previously
mentioned, from the superficial gentility of the middle and later part
of the Victorian era, to the common-sense practical way we now have
of reasoning out the social and political events of the day. This
change, if guided by proper thought and consideration for others, will
undoubtedly lead to a better and happier England. There are, however,
still many changes required, especially in the making and selling
of books; and it is to be hoped that by a greater union and more
harmony and uniformity in the trade, a more general prosperity will be
associated with it, and that many of the disputes and difficulties,
often more imaginary than real, will be avoided. It appears to me that
the shortest way to attain these ideals will be a central control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
consisting of representatives of both masters and men in the publishing
and bookselling trade, who will settle disputes and whose aim will be
to see that a satisfactory profit is realized by the various interests
represented. This question has been more fully dealt with in a later
chapter.</p>

<p>The Elementary Education Act which was passed by W.E. Forster in 1870
created a great change in the educational literature of this period,
the sum asked for in Parliament in 1871 being about one and a half
million pounds. What the future educational grant will be, it is
impossible to say, though it is to be hoped that it will make as great
an improvement in the people as it has done in educational literature.</p>

<p>Another noticeable fact in connexion with books is the few foreign
books&mdash;especially French&mdash;which are now translated and issued in this
country. The following authors at this early period had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> very large
sales: Victor Hugo, Jules Verne, Figuier, Erckmann-Chatrian and others.</p>

<p>It was in July, 1869, that Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co. gave their first
and last dinner in celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the
present building in Stationers' Hall Court, at which the then head of
the firm, Mr. John Miles, presided. It was a most social and happy
event, and I wish the celebration had been continued. I remember
that one of the old hands, William Griffiths, sang a song of his
own composition which showed the good feeling then existing between
employer and employed. I can only give one of the verses:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">"Then here's success to Simpkin's Firm and may they always find,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In studying their interest us ever of one mind;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">May their connexion far and wide extend the globe around,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And as each year shall onward roll may all of us be found</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">In this fine new house I'm singing of,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">One of the olden time."</span><br />
</p>

<p>to which I certainly say Amen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>Before Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co. added to their premises the building
which now runs into Ave Maria Lane, these were occupied by a competing
wholesale firm named Whittaker &amp; Co. The two houses were on good terms,
and, when out of stock of certain books, we could always borrow from
our neighbouring firm, which shows that a good feeling existed at
this period even between competitors. This business was taken over by
Messrs. W. Kent &amp; Co. in 1876.</p>

<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></p>

<p class="center">Some Further Recollections and Reflections</p>


<p class="drop">I<span class="uppercase">n</span> my previous chapter I dealt with many things in the book trade which
impressed me more particularly in the first years of my Stationers'
Hall Court experience. I will now try to give a brief account of other
incidents with which I was associated during some of the following
years. These are not stated in chronological order but have been jotted
down as they have reappeared in my memory.</p>

<p>One thing which has struck me is to find what a number of publishers
during the last fifty years have either ceased to exist or have been
incorporated with other firms; many of them being houses of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
importance and publishers of a considerable number of popular books.
The following are some of the firms which I am able to call to my
memory which were then in existence: Messrs. Walton &amp; Maberley, A.W.
Bennett, J. Bennett, J. Russell Smith, H. Colburn, John Maxwell (the
husband of Miss Braddon), Bradbury, Evans &amp; Co., J.C. Nimmo (the
publisher of many beautiful books), Houlston &amp; Wright (the publishers
of the Enquire Within series), Groombridge &amp; Son, Rivington &amp; Co.
(taken over by Longmans &amp; Co.), J. Masters, W. Hunt, W. Mackintosh,
E. Moxon (the early publisher of Tennyson's and Swinburne's works),
J. Camden Hotten (who published and introduced into this country Mark
Twain, Bret Harte, and Artemus Ward. He died at the age of forty, and
his business was taken over by Messrs. Chatto &amp; Windus), J.C. Newby,
Saunders &amp; Ottley, Griffith &amp; Farran (the successors to John Newbery),
W. Day &amp; Son (high-class printers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> publishers), W. Tegg, Hardwick,
J. &amp; C. Mozley, A. Strahan (one of the most enthusiastic publishers of
his day), Tinsley Bros. (they published for T. Hardy, George Meredith,
and Miss Braddon), R. Bentley (his business was taken over by Macmillan
in 1898), N. Trübner, and Charles Knight (who died in 1873, aged 81;
he was the first publisher of the British Almanac and Companion and
also issued the Penny Cyclopædia and the History of England, with other
interesting and educational work), L. Booth, Virtue, R. &amp; A. Suttaby,
Smith Elder &amp; Co. (now incorporated with John Murray), and many others.
It is also somewhat astonishing what a change has taken place in
the character of the books issued by some publishers. To instance a
few, Messrs. Cassell &amp; Co. principally issued educational and serial
publications, C. Griffin were educational and religious publishers,
Messrs. Nelson &amp; Son published mainly juveniles, including a large
selection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> of 1<i>d.</i>, 2<i>d.</i>, 3<i>d.</i>, 4<i>d.</i>, and 6<i>d.</i> books. Messrs. W.
Collins &amp; Son were also educational and religious publishers.</p>

<p>I should like to place on the other side some of the gains the
publishing trade has received, and mention new firms that are among the
leaders of the trade to-day. Messrs. Methuen &amp; Co. have by a literary
judgment and a judicial trend established one of the leading publishing
businesses since the period before mentioned.</p>

<p>In 1894 Mr. W. Heinemann issued his first original popular 6<i>s.</i> novel;
this was Sir Thomas Hall Caine's "The Manxman," which not only had a
great sale but was a send off such as few publishers have experienced.
This novel being first issued in the 6<i>s.</i> form, had a considerable
influence in bringing the three-volume novel to an end in 1897. The
credit, however, for the original 6<i>s.</i> novel must be given to Mr.
Vizetelly, who commenced some ten years earlier the issue of his
one-volume 6<i>s.</i> novel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> series, which contained, beside other important
novels, "A Mummer's Wife," by George Moore. Mr. J.M. Dent, in founding
the "Every Man Library," made for his firm a name which is known
throughout the world. In this he established a library of literary
classics in its broader sense, issuing them in every particular worthy
of the books produced. He has thus earned the gratitude of students in
every country in which the English language is spoken or read. This
firm has also produced many works of great literary and epoch-making
value.</p>

<p>Important additions to literature, including Fiction, have been made by
such firms as Messrs. Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Hutchinson &amp; Co., T. Fisher
Unwin, Constable &amp; Co., E. Arnold, G. Harrap, Sidgwick &amp; Jackson,
Eveleigh Nash, A. Melrose, T. Werner Laurie, Duckworth, Selwyn &amp;
Blount, H. Jenkins, J. Lane, Chatto &amp; Windus, with others, all of whom,
it is hoped, have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> great future before them. In 1873 the Cambridge
University Press opened their business premises in Paternoster Row;
previous to this, Messrs. Rivington &amp; Co. had acted as their London
agents.</p>

<p>In 1874 the Oxford University Press began their now very important
business under the management of Mr. Frowde. It is now managed by Mr.
Humphrey Milford.</p>

<p>I cannot, however, help thinking that there were more books of what
may be termed a literary or classical character issued and sold during
the early part of my career than there are to-day. It certainly
looks as though the publishers of the future will have considerable
opportunities of issuing the works of some of the great masters in
literature. Whether or not we are to-day producing works of a character
which will be sought for and collected by future generations it is
difficult to say. There is one thing certain, however, and that is the
spirit and desire to collect first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> editions of special authors was
never greater than it is now. Undoubtedly, the desire to write books
as well as to read them is an element to be dealt with, and if it were
possible for the publisher to be so gifted that he would publish only
books that were really worth publishing, much of the rubbish now being
issued and which has only an ephemeral sale would never spoil paper and
print. We shall, I suppose, never get perfection, but that is no reason
why we should not aim at getting it.</p>

<p>Take poetry, for instance. In my young days, Milton, Tupper,
Longfellow, Keats, Shelley, Byron, with others, were considered the
leading sellers, while Tennyson, W. Morris, Swinburne, Lewis Morris,
the Brownings, were fast pushing some of the older poets out of
existence and gaining a deserved popularity, which will last for many
generations. Tennyson's popularity was such that it was reported that
when he changed his publishers from Moxon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> Strahan the latter
promised to give him annually the sum of £4,500 for the right to
publish his books. There are few poets to-day who could command such an
arrangement.</p>

<p>Then there is Swinburne, who in one of his volumes had expressed
himself somewhat too realistically and was refused further publication
by E. Moxon. Some of his later works were issued by J.C. Hotten and
afterwards by Chatto &amp; Windus. There are few, if any, publishers to-day
who would take up the Moxon attitude, but times have changed for the
better.</p>

<p>In 1890 there were 114 volumes of poetry published, in 1891, 146; and I
should conclude that from that period up to the beginning of the war,
the number issued fluctuated to a very small extent. In the classified
analysis of books and new editions published in 1917, poetry and the
drama numbered 544, while in 1918 there were 642 published, which shows
that the war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> has had a considerable influence in providing food for
the imagination, poetry being frequently a true interpretation of the
feelings of the individual as well as of the nation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Victorian era was noted for the issue of many books which sent
a thrill of excitement through both the religious and intellectual
world. It was in 1867 that "Essays and Reviews" was published, and
as it contained contributions by some of the leading men of that
period, it greatly influenced the tendency towards liberty of thought
and helped forward the period when human life and reason should have
its consideration as well as the supernatural. Darwin's "Origin of
Species" was still a living influence, although published in 1859,
and undoubtedly prepared the way for such men as Huxley and Herbert
Spencer. It is not too much to say that these, with other books by men
of like opinions, created the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> spirit of reason and toleration which is
having its effect upon the life and education of to-day.</p>

<p>The Victorian era has also been termed the age of the novelist. To
a certain extent that is true, as we undoubtedly had during Queen
Victoria's reign some of the greatest authors of fiction that this
nation has ever produced. To confirm this it is only necessary to
mention the names of such men as Charles Dickens, W.M. Thackeray,
George Meredith, Thomas Hardy, R.D. Blackmore, H.S. Merriman, C.
Kingsley, S.R. Crockett, Charles Reade, Anthony Trollope, Wilkie
Collins, Charles Lever, Lord Lytton. All of these authors still have
a large number of readers and admirers and their circulation has been
enormous.</p>

<p>It is perhaps a debatable question whether the female novelists of this
period will live as long as the male novelist. Undoubtedly there were
many whose works had very important sales, such as Charlotte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> Brontë,
Mrs. Henry Wood, Miss Braddon, Miss Muloch, Miss C.M. Yonge, Edna
Lyall, Mrs. Sewell, Mrs. Oliphant, with many others; but I think it
very doubtful if a collected edition, from a literary point of view, of
many of these authors will ever be undertaken by a publisher.</p>

<p>At this period the publishing arrangements between this country and
America were in a most unsatisfactory condition, there being only
a Copyright Act which allowed an American to possess copyright in
England while no Englishman could hold copyright in the United States,
so that directly a book obtained popularity in either country it was
reprinted, much to the loss of both author and publisher. I remember
that in America a very popular novel had been published entitled
"Arthur Bonnicastle." The American publisher, with the idea of securing
copyright in England, had the last chapter printed and published here
prior to the publication of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> the book, but a firm of London publishers,
knowing its popularity in America, had printed an edition before
hearing of the arrangement for the last chapter. They were therefore
compelled to strike out the last chapter, as the copyright in this
country had been secured, and issued the book with an explanatory
preface exposing the injustice of allowing an American firm to secure
copyright in this country while no Englishman could hold copyright in
the United States. This action probably helped considerably the passing
of the various Copyright Acts which have made it now possible for the
authors in each country to obtain greater satisfaction from the results
of their labours than they had done in previous years.</p>

<p>It was about 1870 that Edna Lyall's books became very popular, and,
being on very friendly terms with Mr. C. Layton, the representative in
London of Messrs. Appleton &amp; Co. of New York, I suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> that his
firm should reprint this author's books in America. This was done,
and they proved a very great success. There was, however, one very
satisfactory arrangement between the principal American publishers
which I dare say may have existed in this country. This was that
any American publisher who was first in the field with an English
author was not afterwards interfered with, however popular the author
might become. I know this was the case with Edna Lyall, who received
considerable sums from her American publishers, although they had no
copyright in her books.</p>

<p>In relation to copyright, I will mention a great event which took
place in 1912: the closing for ever of the necessary registration
at Stationers' Hall of all books published to secure copyright.
The original charter was granted in 1557 and varied according to
alterations made by Parliament. The old Copyright Act was limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> to
seven years after the death of the author, or forty-two years from
the date of publication, whichever should be longer. The new Act gave
a term of copyright for life and fifty years after. It came into
operation on July 1, 1912, and from that date no registration was
required.</p>

<p>Though the new Act has undoubtedly many advantages one cannot help
regretting that this source of important details respecting titles,
authors and other information, has now ceased and that a system which
shows the registration of some of Shakespeare's plays, and many other
books of which all lovers of English literature are justly proud, is
closed for ever. The last book to be registered by the Stationers'
Company was "A Guide to the Shops Act," which appears rather an
ignominious ending.</p>

<p>One never-to-be-forgotten event took place in 1885, upon the
publication of the Revised Version of the Bible. The Oxford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> &amp;
Cambridge University Presses had united in purchasing the publishing
rights, for which it was reported they paid some £20,000. The New
Testament had been published in 1881, and it was reported that over one
million copies were sold within twenty-four hours of its publication,
so when the complete Bible was issued the excitement was intense.
Numbers could only be supplied in small quantities and for many weeks
the greatest anxiety prevailed in the trade. The desire to obtain
copies not only for this country but also for our Colonies was very
great. Eventually the supply was equal to the demand, but, judging
from opinions now occasionally expressed, it does not appear that the
revised edition is the final edition. In all probability we shall have
a revised edition of the revised version.</p>

<p>While speaking of the Bible, I am proud to be the possessor of a copy
of the one hundred copies produced for the Caxton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> Celebration in 1877.
This copy was presented to me by Mr. Frowde, who had so much to do with
its production by the Oxford University Press. At a luncheon given
after the opening of the Caxton Exhibition, at which Mr. Gladstone,
amongst others, was present, he addressed the audience, and, holding up
a copy of this edition in his hand, explained how it had been produced.
This, he said, was partly performed at Oxford and partly at London. The
impression was limited to 100 copies, and not a sheet was worked from
the printing press until the clock struck two on the morning of the
30th June, 1877, the day of the luncheon; the copies were then printed,
dried, hot pressed and sent to London by an early train, taken to the
binding works of the Oxford warehouse, rolled, folded, rolled again,
pressed, collated, sewed, backed, cut, gilt, and excellently bound
in morocco, all within twelve hours. The first copy was sent to Mr.
Gladstone. The production<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> of such a book in such a short space of time
must have created a record. It was a wonderful performance of which the
Oxford University Press may be justly proud, and I am very delighted to
possess a copy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Probably there is no other word in the English language that conveys a
greater and a more varied meaning than that of Books. Besides reminding
us of the books we have known and loved, it also throws the mind back
to ancient history and the records handed down to us on Babylonian
bricks or Egyptian papyrus. It was said by St. John, some 2,000 years
ago, that if all the books had been written which might have been
written upon a particular subject, the world itself could not contain
them. If the world could not have contained them 2,000 years ago, what
would have been the condition of affairs since the introduction of
printing?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Records of different nationalities are being continually discovered
and printed, and there are few things more fascinating than the
knowledge they reveal of ancient history and the manners and customs
of the ancient peoples. Recent explorations have greatly added to our
knowledge of the past and probably, when some of the Eastern peoples
have settled down to peaceable pursuits instead of national war and
strife, we shall have given to us from the sands of Asia and Africa,
records and information which will astonish the world, for if, as Dr.
Keith states, this world has probably been inhabited for some fifteen
millions of years it is to be hoped that records of its peoples' lives
and habits exist, and that in some way they have been preserved.</p>

<p>Although all lovers of books and literature are interested in these
ancient records, I do not intend attempting even a sketch of these
fascinating periods of history and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> literature, but shall deal with a
slight summary of a few names of authors, from the time of the first
book printed by Caxton in 1474. This was entitled "Recuyell of the
Historyes of Troye," which it is said laid a foundation upon which
has been built the greatest of all the elements which will endow the
world with civilization. It is generally understood that one hundred
different volumes were issued from the Caxton press. It is, I suppose,
a somewhat debatable question whether true literature really gained or
lost by the introduction of printing; but it is quite certain that its
influence for good has been very great. By the making of books, and
thus being able to circulate in a cheaper form the old literature and
help on the making of the new, it acted as a stimulus for good which
developed greatly during the following centuries.</p>

<p>Take the Bible alone; it is to the wide circulation given to it through
the intro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>duction of printing that we owe the peace and goodwill
that are by degrees permeating the civilized world. We do not know
what literature had been destroyed during previous ages, but through
the printing press many great authors of the fifteenth and sixteenth
century have been preserved and have left for all time works of which
the English-speaking race are justly proud. Among these authors are
Francis Bacon, Francis Beaumont, William Camden, George Chapman, John
Donne, M. Drayton, R. Hakluyt, G. Herbert, Richard Hooker, Ben Jonson,
John Knox, John Lyly, Robert Herrick, Christopher Marlowe, Sir Walter
Ralegh, William Shakespeare, Sir Philip Sidney, Edmund Spencer, and
many others.</p>

<p>The authors of the seventeenth century also contributed largely to
the literature of this country, among them being Joseph Addison,
Richard Baxter, Sir T. Browne, John Bunyan, the Earl of Clarendon,
John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> Dryden, John Locke, John Milton, Samuel Pepys, Sir W. Temple,
Henry Vaughan, Edmund Waller, Isaac Walton, Daniel Defoe, A. Pope, S.
Richardson and Jonathan Swift. This list could be largely increased
by the addition of many well-known authors of later periods, but
undoubtedly the introduction of printing greatly stimulated the love of
literature and books which has grown up to the present day.</p>

<p>I have not attempted to give the names of authors who lived during the
eighteenth or nineteenth century as many of them are as familiar as
household words. During the last and the present century, there have
been many authors whose works will be read by generations yet to come,
but it is quite a question whether or no a great change has not taken
place in the present-day lovers of books, both in the serious reader
as well as the lover of lighter literature. Undoubtedly the war has
not only made people think, but has made them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> reason upon the why
and the wherefore of things. I cannot help feeling that the future of
literature as well as that of daily life will have to be viewed from
more solidly scientific foundations, and people will want books in
which the facts of life are interwoven with the everyday possibilities
of life and much of the supernatural imaginings will have gone for
ever. Future authors have a great source in the present to draw upon
in the moral and physical as well as the ideal life. Those who have
the clearest ideas upon these points will be those whose works will be
handed down to the generations yet to come. These views are not so much
from the authors' point of view, as of one who has been associated with
books and has watched events for over sixty years. During that period
there have been many and important changes in the character of books as
well as of public opinion with regard to them. I anticipate, however,
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> greater changes are possible in the near future.</p>

<p>From my own observation I cannot help feeling that the future of making
and selling books, apart from authorship, will involve many changes.
What a great influence must have been exercised by the sending out to
the trenches and to all the various departments and agencies connected
with the war, the millions of books and miscellaneous reading matter
to those engaged in the war. Few people realize to what an enormous
extent this was done. It was officially stated that in January, 1919,
the Camps Library dispatched to France 129,000 novels, and 60,000 other
publications were forwarded regularly every week. These are in addition
to those sent out by the American Government and by the Y.M.C.A. and
other agencies, and as there will be more money earned in the future
by the people generally than there has ever been before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> it is to be
hoped that they will spend some of it upon books.</p>

<p>What I shall hope to see is that every place which is established
for public recreation or instruction has a well-selected library and
reading-room. We can only speculate upon the good this would do,
although I am firmly convinced that the great work which the Free
Libraries have done, and are still doing, will be largely extended. Our
young people must have some place of interest to which they can always
go. Then we shall be a happier and more contented people. Besides
this, the author with high and noble ideals will have some object in
producing works which help to nobler thoughts and aspirations, works
which lead to a higher and better life. Books enable us to realize
our lives and make us feel the wonder and mystery of the world, they
widen our horizon and create a sympathy with humanity. The influence of
literature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> marks the growth of liberty and joy.</p>

<p>The buying and selling of books is a delightful occupation. The
bookseller in his work lives in a bygone world as well as in the
present. Speaking for myself, I know what a comfort it is in old age
to have an exhaustless treasury in books, to have the best in life of
all the ages to fall back upon. The man who gives up his work to enjoy
old age has nothing to fear if his mind is enriched by knowledge of the
best in life and can enjoy the sympathy and friendship of books.</p>

<p>My own love of books was the cause of my entering to a small extent
into authorship. Besides occasionally contributing to our trade
journals, I also wrote articles in the "Encyclopædia Britannica"
on publishing, etc., and also in "The Nineteenth Century," "The
Fortnightly Review," and other journals. Some of these I afterwards
collected in a volume which I published in 1912 under the title of
"The Fascination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> of Books." I have also issued volumes entitled
"The Pleasure of Literature and the Solace of Books," "Saunterings
in Bookland," and others. I have also published yearly since 1903,
a little "Friend to Friend Kalendar," to which each year I have
contributed a poem on Friendship. This has not only had a large
circulation, but has brought me many letters of appreciation and added
to my many friendships.</p>

<p>The trade of the bookseller, as we now know him, has gradually
developed from the early part of the last century. Until then the
bookseller either largely printed, or in association with other
publisher-booksellers joined in producing, many of the books they
sold, the various bookselling partners whose names were on the
title page sometimes numbering over twenty different firms. The
making and selling of books has now developed into many different
channels. There is the Author, the Author's Agent, the Publisher, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
wholesale Distributor, and lastly, but not the least important, is the
Bookseller. These various mediums through which most books must pass,
have to be considered, particularly as regards terms, and although a
book may cost little in its production, there are many expenses to be
considered before its selling price can be fixed. This has led to much
dissatisfaction during the past fifty years, and although arrangements
entirely satisfactory to the trade generally have not yet been made,
it is now in a more flourishing condition than it has ever been. What
I think is now required is the formation of a Booksellers' Central
Committee, of which Authors, Publishers, and Booksellers should become
members. This would exclude the Author's Agent and every one not
directly connected with the trade of bookselling, as printers, binders
and others have their own organizations. Committees of each branch of
the trade should be formed to deal with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> all trade technicalities,
but discussions by the members in Council would be allowed upon any
departmental difficulty, and the decision of the whole body accepted as
final.</p>

<p>In connexion with this body, an arrangement might be made whereby the
trade assistants could have a separate establishment for educational
and other matters connected with the trade. They should have the
power of electing a certain number of members to represent them when
any Trades Union or other difficult question came up for general
consideration. The future is full of difficulties, and it is only
through friendly discussions among the various representatives of all
departments of the bookselling trade that these difficulties can be
satisfactorily settled.</p>

<p>The need for some progressive alteration in the trade must be apparent
to every one associated with it, especially when we look back for
some fifty years and remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> the difficulties that then existed
respecting the giving of discounts to the public, and then consider how
during the terrible war now brought to a close and in the years since,
the question of discounts has seldom arisen. Those who remember the
difficulties which the discount system caused at the before-mentioned
period will feel thankful for the part taken in its abolition by the
united action of the Publishers' and Booksellers' Associations, and
especially by the general establishment of the net book system and in
many cases the doing away with the odd copy. But this subject has been
more fully dealt with in the chapter on Underselling.</p>

<p>It is, however, only by trade organization that difficulties which
must in future arise can be solved, and it is to be hoped that it
will further the interest of the assistants and the younger members
of the trade so that instead of that want of knowledge which we often
hear expressed, we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> have men engaged who are worthy of their
craft, and with altered surroundings bookselling, if not regarded as a
profession, may be considered as an occupation of light and leading.</p>

<p>I have not dealt here with what is known as the second-hand bookseller.
He is the one individual in our trade whom I envy. It is true that
while he deals with the books of the past the ordinary bookseller deals
with those of the present, and those to come. His knowledge, however,
of his particular branch of trade is, I think, wonderful, for not only
does he know the history of a book from its birth to its place upon his
shelves, but a little conversation with him and a walk round his shop
and the taking down some of the books from their shelves, is sufficient
to make any book-lover forget this world in the pleasure and imaginings
of those precious treasures which to know is to revere.</p>

<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></p>

<p class="center">Some Personal Associations</p>


<p class="drop">I <span class="uppercase">have</span> entitled this chapter "Some Personal Associations," and will
first speak of a great and happy event which was only ended after
forty-three years of married life.</p>

<p>It was in 1868 that I became engaged and in 1870 married, a marriage
for which no man ever had more cause to be thankful than myself, owing
to the true happiness of my married life, the sympathy, kind thought
and consideration of my late wife. In fact, everything which goes to
make this life worth living was mine, or I may say ours.</p>

<p>Like everything earthly, alas! it came to an end; but while memory
lasts it will never be forgotten. Recalling all this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> while thankful
for a very happy past, I face what is left to me of the future with a
thankful heart. I am also thankful for my dear children, who have all
taken up their positions in life and are battling with its duties. They
are to me an inexpressible comfort and a blessing, and I can only hope
they will pass through and enjoy their lives as much as I have done
mine.</p>

<p>I should like to refer here to one other great event in my life, that
of becoming a Managing Director of Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent &amp;
Co., Ltd., in 1894. My great aim in life had always been to climb the
ladder of prosperity as far as I possibly could.</p>

<p>While speaking of Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co., I may mention a few
traditional facts regarding the origin and development of that
important firm in its connexion with the bookselling trade. Its
originator and founder was Mr. Benjamin Crosby, whose descendants are
now represented by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> firm of Messrs. Crosby, Lockwood &amp; Co., and
whose predecessors were in past years partners of Simpkin, Marshall
&amp; Co. Mr. Benjamin Crosby came from Yorkshire to London and was
apprenticed to a bookseller, James Nunn, in Great Queen Street; he
afterwards worked for George Robinson, who was then considered the
"King of Booksellers"; finally, he took over the business of Mr.
Stalker in Stationers' Hall Court, whose premises were then situated
upon the same ground as the buildings now occupied by Simpkin,
Marshall, Hamilton, Kent &amp; Co. After an attack of paralysis in 1814,
Mr. Benjamin Crosby parted with his business to W. Simpkin and R.
Marshall. I have always understood that Simpkin was a hatter in Bridge
Street, Blackfriars, and, having capital, he associated himself with
Marshall, who was an assistant of Benjamin Crosby.</p>

<p>They, however, took over only the London trade portion of the business,
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> country portion going to Baldwin, Cradock &amp; Joy. This firm failed
in 1837, and the country portion of the old firm came into the hands of
Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co.</p>

<p>In 1829 Simpkin retired from the business, and the financial management
of the firm was taken over by Mr. John Miles, senior, under whose
supervision very satisfactory results were obtained. Mr. Miles was
also associated with the publishing business of Joseph Johnson of
St. Paul's Churchyard, who issued the works of the poet Cowper, the
critical writings of Priestley, and other important works. Being thus
connected with bookselling, Mr. Miles placed his two elder sons in
important positions in the trade. The one, named after his father,
entered the firm of Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co., and Mr. Joseph Johnson
Miles, evidently named after his publisher friend, entered the firm
of Hamilton, Adams &amp; Co. Later on, two other sons of Mr. John Miles,
senior, entered the firm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co., and still later
several grandsons became partners in the two separate firms before
mentioned.</p>

<p>The same traditions of business were continued and carried on for
nearly eighty years. It is rather remarkable that, in the period which
followed, an amalgamation should take place in 1889 between these two
firms and Messrs. W. Kent &amp; Co., and that, after so many years of
competition, they should be brought together into one trading company.</p>

<p>In the busy whirl of Stationers' Hall Court, though there was little
opportunity for humour, something occasionally happened that permeated
the whole house with amusement, such as when a mistake had been made
and one of the partners tried to find out who had made it. However,
not being able to discover the offender, he came at last to the most
humorous man in the house and tried to fasten it upon him but failed.
"Well," he said, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> energy, "I must hang somebody." After a pause,
the answer came: "Hang me, sir; I want a rise." With a smile the
principal left the room and nothing more was heard of the mistake.</p>

<p>Many such incidents have occurred, but they have been lost by the
hurrying on of time. This subject, however, has been dealt with in an
article entitled "Bookselling and some of its Humours," in my volume on
"The Fascination of Books," published in 1912.</p>

<p>Among my later duties at Stationers' Hall Court was that of
superintending the purchase, or, as it is termed, the subscription of
new books. Every new book issued from the various publishers was first
submitted to Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co., and the number they bought often
governed the numbers purchased by the various members of the trade.
These varied according to the author's reputation and the sales of
their previous issues, and in many cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> from a small number to many
hundreds were usually ordered. I remember on one occasion a 6<i>s.</i> book
by a popular novelist was submitted to us and an order given for 12,000
copies. October is undoubtedly the most important publishing month of
the year, and upon many days during that period, between 150 to 200
different books have frequently been offered for subscription.</p>

<p>In 1917 I retired from the position of a Managing Director, but still
remain one of the Directors of the Company. It is to me a very great
pleasure to be still associated with a house to which I owe so much
and occasionally to see the many valued friends with whom I have been
associated for over fifty years. Although I have nominally ceased to be
a bookseller yet I have several connexions which I hope will keep me
in touch with the trade as long as I live. Besides being a Director of
Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent &amp; Co.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> Ltd., I have been for many
years Chairman of Messrs. Henry Williams &amp; Co. (Old Bailey), Ltd., also
a Director of Messrs. C.W. Faulkner &amp; Co., Ltd., and other companies,
so I am still anything but an idle man.</p>

<p>Although this chapter may appear somewhat egotistical, during my life
in London I have been connected with many trade and other associations
which have been more or less of a personal as well as of an interesting
character, and I mention these facts to show that I have not been
indifferent to or wanting in sympathy with the various undertakings in
which I am concerned.</p>

<p>My first experience was in joining the Committee of the Early Closing
Association, then in quite an elementary condition. Like many other
Associations which have had small beginnings, it has worked its way
through storm and sunshine and has done, and is still doing, much
useful work. At the present moment, it is one of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> helpful
influences in bettering the condition of the worker. At one of our
meetings, held, I think, at St. James's Hall, I had the honour of
being on the platform with Anthony Trollope, the great novelist, and
John McGregor of Rob Roy fame, who each made delightfully interesting
speeches which helped greatly to popularize the Association. I always
felt an interest in young men's associations, and joined one while
living near Highbury. It was at this time that what was then called
Mock Parliaments were usually one of the items in the season's
programme.</p>

<p>At one of these gatherings with which I was associated, I little
thought what a prominent position its leading speakers would hold
in the future. The debate on this occasion was a vote of want of
confidence in Lord Beaconsfield's Foreign policy, as just then there
was much opposition and discontent respecting his actions. This vote
of censure was moved by Lawson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> Walton, who was destined to become
Attorney-General; the present Sir Robert Perks seconded the resolution.
The Chairman or Speaker for the occasion was Sir Clarence Smith,
recently one of the Sheriffs of the City of London. Needless to say,
the motion was carried unanimously. It is pleasant to look back upon
the day of small things and to see the development of lives that are
useful both in their surroundings and to the state.</p>

<p>Another interesting Association was that of the University Extension,
of the Finsbury Park branch of which I was Chairman for several years.
During the autumn of one of our sessions, it was suggested that we
should ask Chevalier Marconi, who was just then beginning to be
known as an inventor of some new method of telegraphy, to give us a
demonstration of his wireless process. He agreed to do so, but little
did we think what would be the result of this system and what wonderful
influence his dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>covery would have upon the civilised world.</p>

<p>As Chairman, it was my pleasurable duty to receive Chevalier
Marconi, and I was greatly surprised to find so young and apparently
inexperienced a person. A few minutes' conversation, however, soon
showed that he had a firm foundation for the subject which he was
developing. We had arranged to get communication between Highgate and
New Southgate, where we were holding the demonstration. Unfortunately,
the poles for dispatching the messages to be sent from Highgate did
not arrive in time, so we had to content ourselves with having the
messages sent from a field close by. Everything worked to our entire
satisfaction, and various messages were received stamped in accordance
with the Morse system. Whenever there is any further development of the
Marconi system I look back upon this meeting with considerable interest
and satisfaction. Since then, I have met Chevalier Marconi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> on various
occasions, and he has always struck me as a man of a great personal
character and solid determination. One thing which I remember to have
heard him say was that "My father was an Italian and my mother an
Irishwoman, but I call myself an Englishman"; and I am sure he is one
of whom we are all proud.</p>

<p>My association with politics began with my early years at home, when
I watched my father, carrying the Union Jack, marching at the head
of the voters in our village to the polling booth. Although father
was not in any way a public man, he knew what progress meant and was
always on that side. I do not remember any political influence being
exercised upon me in my young days, and appeared naturally to drift
into the ranks of Liberalism, a drifting which I have never regretted.
Being an active student of parliamentary events, shortly after coming
to London, I obtained admission to the Strangers'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> Gallery at the
House of Commons, and soon felt a keen interest in politics and often
afterwards visited the House. I have many times walked to Islington
from the Houses of Parliament at two o'clock in the morning after
having listened to some interesting debate. I have heard Gladstone,
Disraeli, and most of the party leaders in both Houses. I was in
the Gallery of the House of Commons when W.E. Forster was carrying
through the Elementary Education Act and the Vote by Ballot Bill.
These were opposed, for the Conservative Party, by the then Sir
Stafford Northcote, and, although my mind was quite made up as to their
desirability, when hearing the eloquence and arguments from the other
side, without a strong opinion one might have been easily carried over
to the Opposition.</p>

<p>In 1888 I greatly enjoyed a visit to the House, on the occasion when
Mr. Ritchie, as he then was, brought in the Bill to create the London
County Council. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> Gladstone sat on the Opposition Bench with Sir
James Stansfeld, the Member for Halifax and the President of the
Local Government Board in the previous Liberal Administration. As Mr.
Ritchie unfolded his scheme, both Mr. Gladstone and Sir James Stansfeld
were busy taking notes. When the main details of the Bill had been
explained, they both ceased, being apparently satisfied with the scope
of the Bill. As soon as Mr. Ritchie sat down, Mr. Gladstone rose. In a
short and eloquent speech, he complimented the hon. gentleman on his
proposed Bill and said that although he might suggest some amendments
in Committee, they, as a party, quite approved of the principles of
the Bill. Owing to Mr. Gladstone's statement, what was expected to
be a hot party debate ended in a satisfactory agreement. Even after
such interesting proceedings as these, I have always felt that the
anticipation of a debate in Parliament is greater than the pleasure
realized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>This Bill was eventually passed, and among the candidates for
membership of the new London County Council was Lord Rosebery, who
stood for the City of London. I had the pleasure of hearing him address
several meetings, and, although from a public point of view he was
a comparatively young man, he spoke with great thought and feeling,
always carrying his audience with him. He was of course returned, and
was elected the first Chairman of this important Council.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that nearly all my life I have been more or less
associated with politics, and for over forty years have been upon the
register of voters, I have never voted on the winning side except on
the occasion when Mr. A.J. Balfour stood for the City of London. I
still hope I may do so before I die.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1885, after the passing of the Redistribution
Bill, that I became more closely associated with politics. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> this
Redistribution Act, Middlesex (for many years it had been represented
by two members) was divided into seven constituencies. I joined the
Liberal Association in Hornsey, one of the new divisions, and the
one in which I then lived, and from that time onwards took an active
part in their proceedings. On the eve of the first elections in these
divisions, we had a big send-off meeting of the Middlesex candidates
at the Holloway Hall, at which the great Liberal veteran Mr. Samuel
Morley presided. Many leading politicians were present, including
Sir Charles Dilke, Mr. W.S. Caine, Mr. Alfred Milner (now Viscount
Milner), who stood for the Harrow Division, Mr. S.D. Waddy, and others.
Great enthusiasm prevailed, but the success at the polling booth was
not as great as we anticipated, and the Hornsey Division returned
a Conservative, which it continued to do until a fresh division of
Middlesex took place under the Act of 1918. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> Carvel Williams, the
champion for Disestablishment of the Church, was our president; he was
a most able and eloquent speaker, full of work and energy and equal to
any emergency, but although we had occasionally such speakers as Mr.
Asquith, Mr. Lloyd George, and other leading politicians of that day,
success at the poll was never obtained.</p>

<p>I was for many years chairman of the Council, and that brought me in
touch with many men of light and leading. I was, however, compelled to
give it up, as so many other duties had a more special call upon my
time. In 1904 I was induced to join the non-political party which was
standing for the London County Council Division of Stoke Newington, and
was returned.</p>

<p>And here let me state that I have a great objection to party feeling
in local affairs. It is quite bad enough when carried to extremes
in parliamentary contests, but local affairs should be dealt with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
entirely from the local point of view of what is best and from none
other. Having made many new friends and being elected to the Library
Committee, I found myself in my element amongst books. Before the Free
Library was started at Stoke Newington, with my good friend Mr. A.W.
Mackenzie, I originated a private Free Library in the Finsbury Park
District, and although this library was not very large it was very
serviceable. It was carried on by voluntary aid and contributions, and,
in accordance with the Act passed in 1892, afterwards taken over by the
Council of Stoke Newington.</p>

<p>When this Free Library was opened, thanks to the Carnegie Trust, I had
the honour of seeing my name engraved with others on a stone tablet
as a record of those who were associated with the founding of it.
My relations with Stoke Newington were always of the most pleasant
character, as there were many book lovers on the Committee, among them
being Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> Wynne Baxter and Mr. Charles Welsh, the noted City Librarian.</p>

<p>It was during my membership of the Stoke Newington Council that I
received tickets of invitation to the inauguration of the L.C.C.
Passenger Steamboat Service on the Thames, which had been constructed
at an outlay of nearly £300,000. Our present King, with some of the
young Princes, headed the fleet of steamers which went from Temple
Pier to Greenwich and back. Altogether it was a most pleasant trip,
but events followed which brought this venture to an end, a decision
from many points of view much to be regretted. It occurs to me,
however, that if more attention were given to the banks of the Thames
by building an Embankment on the south side similar to that on the
north side, there is no reason why it should not eventually become in
every way as attractive as the rivers which flow through so many of the
Continental cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>About this time I became a member of the New Vagabond Club, and enjoyed
for many years the various dinners given to some of the leading men of
the time. These were usually held at the Hotel Cecil, and I have known
over 500 ladies and gentlemen to be present on some of the important
occasions. The Club was very cosmopolitan: Bishops, Members of
Parliament, the theatrical profession, authors&mdash;in fact, anyone who was
then in the public eye was certain to receive an invitation to some of
the dinners. When this club became incorporated with the old Playgoers'
Club, many, like myself, felt that these Sunday festivities did not
quite fall in with their ordinary way of spending the day of rest, and
I was compelled to retire from it.</p>

<p>Another association of which I am particularly proud to be one of the
vice-presidents, is the Booksellers' Provident Institution, and the
Booksellers' Provident Retreat; the former I joined in 1869, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> for
over fifty years have been an active member on its committees. This
great institution was inaugurated on February 15, 1837, at Stationers'
Hall, and during the greater part of its existence it has had for its
president some one representing either the house of Longman or Murray.
It is an institution of which every member is proud, and should be more
appreciated in the trade than it is, for it has done, and is still
doing, work of great value to its necessitous members.</p>

<p>The opening ceremony of the Booksellers' Retreat took place in 1846.
The great novelist Lord Lytton presided, and a sum of £800 was
collected. At this Retreat there are seven pleasantly situated houses
occupied either by members or their widows, and the occupants of these
houses, owing to the funds at the disposal of the Committee, have their
lives not only extended but made thoroughly happy and comfortable.</p>

<p>In 1872 there was a great effort made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> by many of the London
Booksellers' Assistants to found an institution which would be always
open to its members for educational and social purposes. The proposal
met with support, and much discussion upon details took place; but the
only decision arrived at was that it should be called the Booksellers'
Literary Institution. After many meetings and discussions it was
given up and the committee dissolved. It was a noble object, and I
sincerely hope that in the future some such organization will come into
existence, for it is badly wanted both for the assistants and the trade
generally.</p>

<p>In 1898 I had the honour of being elected a member of the Worshipful
Company of Stationers, which is so associated, especially in the
past, with literature and books. I am sure every one who takes the
opportunity of going through the Hall will feel proud of this almost
sacred building. It has a history connected with the makers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> and
distributors of literature which is an honour not only to the trade but
to the nation; I sincerely hope that the policy now being advocated by
the City Livery Club, of which I am also a member, that of more closely
associating the various Livery Companies with the trade or craft by
which they are designated, will be successful. If this can be done, it
will be better for the various City Guilds, as well as the particular
trades after which the Guilds are named.</p>

<p>In 1897 the Prince of Wales, afterwards King Edward VII, inaugurated
the Hospital Fund which still bears his name, to commemorate the
sixtieth year of Queen Victoria's reign. One of the means adopted to
assist in raising funds was the issue of a series of stamps which
varied in price. This series met with great success, and the public
issue of the stamps was entrusted to Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co. After it
had run its course and added considerably to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> the Hospital funds, it
was decided by the authorities that the issue should be discontinued,
and that the plates from which the stamps had been printed should be
destroyed. A special day was fixed for this purpose, and our present
King and Queen, then the Prince and Princess of Wales, kindly consented
to undertake this task. The destruction of the plates took place at the
Bank of England in a small room, and another Director of our Company
and myself were selected to see the operation completed. It was a most
interesting occasion, and, being in so small and informal a place, the
talk between the half-dozen or so witnesses and the Royal destroyers
was very pleasant. With a strong file which was handed to her, the
Princess of Wales, in a most business-like way, rubbed the face of the
metal plates of the stamps and thereby made it impossible for any more
to be printed. Though it all happened in a very short space of time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
it was a delightful as well as an historic gathering.</p>

<p>While speaking of Royalty, I am reminded of an occasion when Edward
VII, then Prince of Wales, opened the Free Library at Lambeth under the
Chairmanship of Mr. Tate, who contributed largely to the Library funds.
The Prince made an excellent speech, short and to the point, although
his articulation was not very clear. This, I suppose, arose through the
many languages which it was necessary for him to master, and it struck
me at the time that his accent was more like that of a foreigner who
had learned English than an Englishman's.</p>

<p>On the issuing of the eleventh edition of the "Encyclopædia
Britannica," I was asked by the editor to write two articles on
Bookselling and Publishing, with biographical notices of British
and American publishers' houses. I did this with much pleasure, and
afterwards received an in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>vitation to a dinner at the Hotel Cecil to
celebrate the Encyclopædia's completion and publication. Among some
600 guests who were present, there were representatives of great
distinction from every department of learning, such as the Speaker
of the House of Commons, Mr. Balfour, Sir W. Harcourt, Lord Brassey,
Lord Bryce and Viscount Wolseley. These names are sufficiently
representative of the guests, although it would be difficult to give a
complete list of them. Altogether, it was a wonderful gathering, and my
association with it was most gratifying to me.</p>

<p class="center">The Bookselling Trade and Underselling</p>


<p class="drop">T<span class="uppercase">he</span> published price of a book being publicly advertised, there is
probably no other trade which gives the same opportunity of attracting
the public by underselling as that of Bookselling, and evils of a
greater or less degree in this direction have been practised since the
days of Caxton. In the early days of the nineteenth century serious
attention was directed to underselling, and an association formed
entitled "The Associated Booksellers." This was formed in 1812, but
the notorious Lackington carried underselling, and what he termed
"remainders," to such an extreme that the very existence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Bookselling trade was seriously threatened. This Association, however,
lacked sufficient strength to take the necessary steps to stop the
underselling mania, and it was not until 1850 that another Booksellers'
Association was formed which nobly fought a most difficult and trying
battle. The Association failed, owing to the decision in 1852 by Lord
Campbell, Mr. Grote, and Dean Milman that the question of a bookseller
having "paid the purchase money shall not resell it under a certain
price, derogated from the rights of ownership which, as purchaser,
he had acquired." This decision had the effect of dissolving the
Association.</p>

<p>Some years after attention was again directed to the evil of
underselling, which it has taken nearly a century to bring to an end,
for it is hoped that by the adoption of publishing on the net book
system and the Publishers' and Booksellers' Associations, discounts
to the public will be entirely abolished. On looking through the
volume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> for 1864 of that consistently intelligent trade journal, "The
Bookseller," I find the editor saying that "The opening of the new
season appears to be a very appropriate time for a few remarks upon
the ruinous system of underselling, which seems to be the rule rather
than the exception, not only in London, but in most provincial cities.
How far it will proceed and what may be the extent of the damage it
may do, none can predict. We, however, believe underselling to be
wholly unnecessary and that it may be checked, if not altogether
stopped, if publishers and booksellers will come to an understanding
on the subject." The article goes on to point out how by publishers,
if necessary, reducing their selling prices, they might do away with
the discount allowed to the public, or, in other words, encourage the
adoption of a net system. It is pleasant to see a letter on this point
issued the same year, and signed by A. Macmillan. When about to publish
their celebrated Globe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> edition of Shakespeare's works at 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>,
after speaking of the number of pages, the quality of the paper, the
printing and the binding, Mr. Macmillan goes on to say, "Why should
the trade throw away their profits on a book that needs no further
cheapening to put it within the reach of all. I have neither the will
nor the power to dictate to the trade what they shall sell the books
for after they buy them from us, but I would be glad and grateful if
they would try the experiment on this new book whether the underselling
which has crept in of late years, does good really to anybody." It is
most gratifying that the present head of that firm should have done so
much to bring to an end the unjust system of discounts. It was stated
that nearly 80,000 copies of the Globe Shakespeare were sold within six
months of its publication.</p>

<p>In 1867, after many years of unrest, matters were again brought
under discussion through Mr. Thomas Bosworth, of Regent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> Street,
giving excessive discounts. I have before me a leaflet issued by this
bookseller entitled "Rattening in the Book Trade." In this leaflet he
complains of Messrs. Hamilton, Adams &amp; Co. having closed his account,
owing to his continuing to sell to the public books at trade prices and
sometimes less than that. This did not continue very long, as I find
that in 1869 he had to make a composition with his creditors. In 1890
the parent of the Associated Booksellers of Great Britain and Ireland
was formed, under the title of "The London Booksellers' Society," and I
am proud to record that I was one of the early members of its Council.
The main object of the Society was to restrict discounts to 25 per
cent., and it issued a price list from 6<i>d.</i> to £2 2<i>s.</i> showing these
discounts. Had it not been for the introduction of the net system, this
Booksellers' Association would in all probability have followed the
footsteps of its predecessors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>A correspondent in "The Bookseller" for 1877 gives a very despondent
account of the bookseller and the way the bookselling trade was
carried on. This despondency was caused mainly by the iniquitous
system of discounts which were then being given to the public and the
unfair methods of business, owing to the want of harmony and business
regulations. The correspondent says that "A bookseller of to-day
is very often a man who might just as well be a cheese-monger or a
pork-butcher for anything he knows or cares about books; and as for him
being capable of guiding or advising his customers, they have sometimes
no little trouble in making him understand a requirement that lies just
outside the current of popular demands. The cause of this degeneracy
is not far to seek: it is the undignified and unneighbourly scramble
for custom, in which each man's object is to give away a larger
discount in the shilling than anyone else. Unless booksellers can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> be
found who will have the courage to stand out of this scramble and be
content to serve such customers who are willing to pay a fair price
for their books, it is to be feared that the race of booksellers will
become extinct." Fortunately, by the introduction of the net system,
this downward tendency has been stopped, and the bookselling trade is
gradually taking the place it deserves in the world of letters.</p>

<p>The Publishers' Association was established in 1896. Mainly through the
influence and the exertions of Sir Frederick Macmillan, the net book
scheme was officially recognized by the Publishers' Association. It
has grown ever since that time and has undoubtedly been the salvation
of the Bookselling trade in this country, and it is hoped that it will
lead to further and better conditions for every one connected with the
trade.</p>

<p>This question of underselling is so closely associated with the
general condition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> Bookselling trade that I have decided to
reprint in this chapter the following article which appeared in
the "Publishers' Circular" and was written by me in 1915. Though a
development in some of the particulars has been obtained, there is
still much to be done. As the article was reprinted and distributed by
the Associated Booksellers, and I also receive so many congratulatory
letters respecting it, I feel that it may probably be of service when
some of the details of the trade are again under discussion. I have
omitted from the article such portions of it as time has shown to be
unnecessary. What I have here reprinted I hope may be found of interest.</p>


<p class="center">SOME NOTES ON BOOK-SELLING</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In using the term "bookselling," it is intended in this article to
include all those businesses, exclusive of authorship, which are
interested in the making, distribution, and selling of books, and
while offering a few suggestions to these trade organizations, there
will be no attempt to dogmatize on any particular sphere of it. As
their working conditions are so continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> changing, these must
therefore fall in with modern requirements or give place to others
which can accommodate themselves to the altered conditions.</p>

<p>Since the origin of printing there have been differences and
grievances, many of them imaginary, in connexion with the trade of
bookselling. Some of these complaints are characterized as a decay
of the author, the book, or the bookseller; sometimes it is the
over-production of books or their cheapness, due to underselling or to
outside firms being allowed to trade in them, but all these complaints
either die a natural death or turn out to have little foundation, and
the trade goes on in much the same way as it has done for centuries
past. There is occasionally a reason for some of these criticisms, and
although there have been variations in both the production and the
distribution of books, yet many of the salient features remain the
same as those existing in the early days of bookselling.</p>

<p>Before suggesting a solution of some of the difficulties which we find
current in the bookselling trade to-day, let us inquire into that of
book production.</p>

<p>Foremost among the real or imaginary difficulties is the question
of over-production. This is, from many points of view, an important
question with distributors of books, both wholesale and retail.</p>

<p>Take the following interesting particulars, which appear somewhat out
of harmony with our unsatisfactory means of distribution, but when
we compare these figures with those of other countries, they seem
insignificant: In the year 1913, 9,541, and in 1914, 8,863 new books
were published in England. In 1913,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> 10,607, and in 1914, 10,175 new
books were published in America. In the year 1912, 34,801 new books
were published in Germany, and in 1913 no fewer than 35,078 were
issued from their various presses. Nearly four times as many books
were thus yearly produced in Germany as in England&mdash;but it must be
admitted that many of these are of a local or ephemeral character&mdash;and
over three times as many as in America. A comparison between the
number of authors and their proportion to the population is no less
surprising. In 1910, there were 9,000 writers of books in America;
there were 8,000 in Great Britain; while in Germany there are over
31,000 of such <i>littérateurs</i>. Of course, the war has greatly changed
these figures.</p>

<p>It is computed that the total number of printed books in the world is
no less than 11,638,810, and that about 8,714,000 of these have been
published subsequently to the year 1800. From 1500 to 1535 the number
of books produced annually averaged only 1,250. It was not until 1700
that the annual average passed 10,000, and it was not until 1887 that
it reached 100,000. From 1900 to 1908, however, the world's annual
output averaged 174,375. Some interesting statistics relating to the
production of printed books are given in the "Bulletin de l'Institut
International de Bibliographie."</p>

<p>The complaint of over-production is almost as old as the art of
printing itself, for, according to Charles Knight's "The Old Printer,"
it is stated that some Roman printers of the Latin Classics in 1471
petitioned the Pope to interfere on their behalf. In their petitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
they stated that "they were the first who introduced this Art, with
vast labour and cost, into His Holiness's territory, and encouraged
by our example, other printers have done the same. If you peruse the
Catalogue of the books printed by us, you will admire how and where
we could produce a sufficient quantity of paper or even rags for such
a number of volumes. The total of these books amount to 12,475, a
prodigious heap, and intolerable by reason of those unsold. We are
unable to bear the expense of housekeeping for want of buyers, of
which there cannot be a more flagrant proof than that our house is
full of quire books, but void of every necessary of life."</p>

<p>From this it would appear that the question of over-production has an
early origin and is continually being repeated, but I dare venture the
remark that there is not now or never has been any over-production
in books that are worth putting on the market, and if publishers
would refuse the bribes offered by those anxious to see their names
in print, and only issue such books as in their mature judgment they
consider worth putting before a community of intelligent readers,
there would be less outcry of over-production. This question is very
far-reaching, and especially affects the sellers of books. Frequently
the publishers issue books, the cost being paid by an ambitious
author; but for this the public would probably never hear of him;
the book is shown to the trade, no reference whatever is made to its
origin, and booksellers are often led to buy and stock a book by their
trust in the publisher, and find out to their cost that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> is no
demand whatever for the book, and it remains upon their shelves. It is
a fair contention that the bookseller should be warned against such
books, in which the publishers have taken no risks, neither should
the booksellers be persuaded into so doing. Undoubtedly, if the trade
is to prosper, there must be more discrimination in selecting stock.
There are now so many influences at work to advertise a book: not
only are there the ordinary media, but an author will go round to the
booksellers, talking about his book, telling them it will sell in
thousands, and that there has never been such a book written before.
Instances have been known where the author has gone to a number of
booksellers and ordered copies of his book, never calling or paying
for them. The bookseller, by these means, has to put into his stock
books which he is unable to sell. There should for safety be a method
of allowing returns to be made of such books before the publishers
make up their accounts; there would then be an inducement for a
bookseller to display a book upon his counter or in his window, with
a possibility of sales being made through the publicity given to the
book.</p>

<p>Many books are published for which no reasonable market exists, but
as long as education continues to influence the mind there will be
found persons who think their ideas are inspired, and they must give
them expression in the printed book. There is to-day a larger reading
public than ever, and the all-important point is how to get hold of
them. On this point much has been written and said. It is of no use
discussing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> the old methods, so much extolled, of how the bookseller
formerly lived over his shop and existed with, if not by, his books,
and what men of encyclopædic knowledge these ancients were. These
times are gone, and the men are gone with them. We must, therefore,
deal with events as they are to-day. Every one engaged in the business
of bookselling would no doubt confess that he is out, <i>inter alia</i>, to
try and make money and earn a living, and this is one of the points I
wish to discuss. First, the men who constitute the bookselling trade
are probably as intelligent and as up to date in knowledge as they
were in the past. It has been said that the second-hand bookseller
is the only man with a knowledge of books, but this is not so.
Unfortunately, the exigence of our social life often prevents him
from giving as much attention to his trade as formerly. This has been
intensified by the margin of profit not being commensurate with the
labour; therefore in many cases other kindred businesses have been
added to that of bookselling.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the greatest benefaction which has ever fallen to the
book trade was the introduction in January, 1900, of the net system.
By this system a reasonable profit was guaranteed, and members of
the book trade were brought together and the trade organized and
extended in a manner which would have been impossible without some
such rallying point as that offered by the net system. This has now
obtained such a hold, both upon the trade and the public, that it must
remain one of the axioms of the bookselling trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>A similar system was started in America in 1901, and for many years
considerably helped the publishers in that country in organizing the
trade, and protecting that of the bookseller in his attempt to remedy
some of the evils caused by undersellers and unfair competition.
Unfortunately, an adverse decision in the American Supreme Court
in what is known as the "Macy case," caused the members of the
Association to wind up their organization. This was done at the end of
1914.</p>

<p>In these days of increased business pressure and competition, it
appears especially unfortunate that so large and important an
organization affecting the publishing trade in America should so
suddenly come to an end. It is, however, hoped that the publishers
will be able before long to reconsider the situation and establish in
some form or other a new representative organization to take charge
of and to promote the general interests of the American publishing
and bookselling trades, for, undoubtedly, without some such central
control, the trade of bookselling cannot thrive in the same manner as
it otherwise would do.</p>

<p>A very important point is the relation of the publishers one to the
other. If there were more trade-regulations to bring into harmony
many of its unwritten laws, some of the difficulties which now often
arise would never occur. At present the Publishers' Association mostly
consider questions outside their own business workings, and nothing
in the shape of terms or personal arrangements is touched upon or
discussed; therefore unnecessary competition and varying terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> exist
to a considerable extent. How much unpleasant feeling might be avoided
if some broad but definite rules were laid down for the guidance of
publishers towards each other, and also to the wholesale and retail
bookselling trades. This question will be further discussed later on.
A very important question is, however, now awaiting solution&mdash;that of
sending out books on sale or return. Continental booksellers adopted
this method of bringing books before the public many years ago, with a
great amount of success and satisfaction, but of course this is a very
debatable question.</p>

<p>It appears somewhat difficult for publishers to realize how much could
often be done by a bookseller in pushing the sale of a book if he were
guaranteed against loss: especially is this applicable to a book by
a new author. How much better it would be for author, publisher, and
bookseller, if in certain cases books, such as before mentioned, could
be shown in windows of retail booksellers, and that the publisher
should take them back or exchange them within, say, six months from
publication, if still unsold. By these means books by unknown authors
would get an advertisement such as could be obtained in no other way,
and it would certainly help the bookseller with a show of books which
at present he is unable to obtain.</p>

<p>It is somewhat strange that so little difficulty regarding cost or
selling price has yet arisen with the issue of the modern cheap
editions of books. These cheap issues are published at net prices,
they yield a fair profit to those through whose hands they pass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> and
the public are quite satisfied. Recent history of popular literature
shows that success is obtained, not by high prices, but by big sales.
What is wanted is the realization of what Matthew Arnold once wrote,
"that he hoped for the day when food and books shall both alike be
felt as needs."</p>

<p>In connexion with the trade of publishing, the question is, how
best to help the bookseller to obtain his supply of books, as the
miscellaneous character of the books published, and the increasing
number of publishers, and the cost of "travelling" books in the
country, make it imperative that some distributing medium should be
engaged in this work. In most countries such an agency exists, but
methods vary in each country; it is represented here by the wholesale
agent, who supplies from his own stock or collects from the publishers
everything a country bookseller may have ordered. By some publishers
this agency has a poor recognition, but without such distributing
houses it would be quite impossible for the ordinary retail bookseller
to obtain his supplies, as the public when ordering books scarcely
ever give the publisher's name, and frequently give half a mutilated
title, which only those in daily intercourse with all published
books could recognize, so that this part of a general system of
distribution should not only be fully recognized by the publisher, but
in calculating discounts and expenses this distributing method should
be considered. One is inclined to ask if there is anything wrong with
the trade; if so, is it with the retail bookseller, for after all it
is this agency which comes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> direct contact with the public. Until
the introduction of the net system before mentioned, there was a war
of discounts existing which would have eventually meant ruin, and it
is only a reasonable conclusion that what every bookseller recognizes
as a good to the trade should be further extended. Is not the time
ripe for more organization, without oppression, to be adopted by
the trade? We have now the organizations of both the publisher and
bookseller, to which all the leading members of each of these branches
of the trade belong. Why cannot, as before suggested, some rules of a
broad but inclusive character be laid down and agreed upon by members
of both associations, so that the differences and difficulties which
so frequently arise may be easily adjusted? By these means a dignity
and influence as of old would be restored to the booksellers, petty
grievances would be easily removed, and the question of a living
discount would be more easily discussed, and the book world (which
formerly had only two interests, that of author and publisher, but now
has the bookseller as a separate factor) would be placed on a firmer
foundation and in the position which, by its literary association, it
deserves.</p>

<p>In recommending closer co-operation between the Publishers' and
Booksellers' Associations in the internal arrangements of the
bookselling trade, my object is to advocate centralization, but with
a liberty which should not be abused. How often a publisher wishes
to bring before the various distributing agencies of the trade some
work in which he has invested intelligence and money, and which is
not a machine-made book!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> If such co-operation can be freed from
jealousies, what better medium could be found for disseminating
information than a central association formed of the above-named
organizations? At first there would be much give and take, but if
there could be a sub-committee of each association formed which would
meet and discuss questions to be submitted to the respective central
councils, matters would soon run smoothly, and if the respective
presidents or secretaries could be so in touch with each other that
preliminary difficulties could be made plain, there is little doubt
that results satisfactory to the trade would follow. That important
results would follow is practically certain. Take, for instance, the
present arrangements for the Annual Meetings of the Publishers' and of
the Associated Booksellers. The only attraction of the former is the
chairman's address, which, although often eloquent, seldom leads to
either a discussion or suggestions, with a result that everything is
cut and dried in the most orthodox and dry-as-dust fashion.</p>

<p>Almost the only difference in the Booksellers' Annual Meeting is
that it brings members together from all parts of the country and
helps to promote social intercourse. Festive gatherings and outings
are a greater attraction than the business agenda, and the business
man must often have forced upon him the fact that time which is
frequently taken up in dinners and receptions could be better spent in
discussing business questions. It can scarcely be denied that the two
trade associations are capable of far greater usefulness than they at
present achieve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>In looking through a recent number of the "Publishers' Weekly," I
was much struck by the practical way in which the annual meetings of
the book trade of America were conducted. From the report of their
proceedings I find that some twelve different subjects associated with
the bookselling trade were discussed, among them being the following:
Undue Competition of Jobbers; Postage Extra; Self-addressed Circulars
issued by Publishers in their interest rather than the Dealers;
Discounts to Lending Libraries; Uniform Discounts according to
quantity purchased for every dealer alike; Failure to include Juvenile
books in the net class.</p>

<p>Surely there could be found a sufficient number of members of the
bookselling trade to discuss some of the above or other subjects to
the advantage of the trade generally?</p>

<p>When one reflects that the yearly output of English books is
considerably less than that of America, which is about one-third that
of Germany, and that one-fifth of the inhabited world is dominated by
the English language, it is surely time for all the members of the
bookselling trade to wake up.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to go into the details of cost prices, but
all are agreed that to make an effectual organization for the book
trade, the question of profits and terms must come in, both for the
publisher as well as for the wholesale and retail bookseller. There
is, however, a question which has often been much discussed as to
whether trade terms should be based on a flat price, or the system
of odd copy and discounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> be continued. There is much to be said
for both systems, but the method of a sliding scale is invariably
used both here and in other countries. In America and Germany, as
well as in this country, sometimes the odd copy is given, and even in
those countries which charge flat rates there is always an advantage
in prices which correspond with numbers. This is only a reasonable
concession to those who will speculate, or have built up a business
in which a considerable amount of capital is locked up. There are few
businesses where speculation is more precarious or where the articles
of commerce so quickly deteriorate in value as that of the bookseller,
and it is hoped that publishers will soon recognize that bookselling
as a trade wants more help and more consideration than it receives at
present. Otherwise, the small man will be pushed out, and the trade
become centralized in a few big establishments, who will be able to
dictate terms for distributing the books published, and a trade union
of distributors may be formed which will prove a harder taskmaster
than the most tyrannical trade union that has ever dictated terms to
its employers. Every one, however, in the trade sincerely hopes that
when the publisher and bookseller are brought more in contact with
each other through their associations, these important points will be
mutually considered from a practical point of view.</p>

<p>It is often wise to see how the business of bookselling is carried on
in other countries, so a glance at some of their methods should be
interesting.</p>

<p>In Germany, before the war, nearly all booksellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> had an agent in
Leipzig. This agent receives his client's order every day, and after
dispatching them to different publishers, he collects the parcels
and sends them off by post or rail. A "collector," as we know him in
London, is not known there.</p>

<p>Most firms give credit, and customers go into Leipzig once every
year to the "Booksellers' House," when they pay their agent and the
publishers.</p>

<p>Firms in Berlin have a special way of dispatching their books,
etc., to other firms in the country. It is a kind of private post
service between the Booksellers' League in Berlin and booksellers and
wholesale agents in other towns. Each member of this League pays a
certain amount yearly, and has his goods sent on by the private post
service. This is not a very quick method, although it is cheap.</p>

<p>The following Consular Report upon this subject will be found
interesting:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Even in this changing age the organization of the German book trade
remains in principle what it has long been. The two main principles
which make the trade as flourishing as it is, are the fixed selling
price and the right of the retailer to return unsold books. The first,
combined with very long credits, is the solid basis of the existence
of the small retail houses, and has favoured the establishment of
retailers everywhere. There is in Germany one bookseller for every
5,000 inhabitants, and the consequence of retail shops being found
everywhere is that the German publisher spends very little in
advertising, for he <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>sends out all his novelties on sale according
to a system established with the retail trade, or special wishes of
the retailers, which he learns by means of his inexpensive circulars.
In no other trade is there so close an understanding cultivated as
between the German bookseller and his educated customers. The retailer
circulates all his new books amongst likely buyers, and they become
better known than through advertisements. The retailer pays for all
the books bought during the year at the Easter Fair of the following
year. The discounts vary according to the class of book, from 25 per
cent. on the selling price of scientific books to 40 and even 50 per
cent. on juvenile literature, besides which eleven copies are sent for
ten, or thirteen for a dozen. The enormous number of scientific books
published in Germany, including pamphlets, can only be explained by
the existence of the intelligent retailers all over the country. The
legal organization of the trade is the Verein in Leipzig, consisting
of 2,685 members, which lays down regulations for the members of
the trade amongst themselves, and for them in their dealings with
the public. Thus the maintenance of the selling price (5 per cent.
being allowed for cash, periodicals excepted) is rigidly insisted
on, and if the rule is broken, it is adjudged by the Verein that
publishers shall not supply the offender, or that they shall give him
no credit or discount. Connected with this institution is a sort of
publishers' and booksellers' clearing house <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>in Leipzig, by which the
ordering by retailers and the keeping of accounts between them and
the publishers are facilitated and simplified, and the processes of
ordering, packing, dispatching, and paying are greatly cheapened. It
appears designed to prevent a great variety of petty expenditure, and
to it, coupled with the fixed selling price and the long credit, is
attributed the success of the trade in Germany.</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, there is that industrious little country, Norway, which has been
termed "A Bookseller's Paradise." But it must be remembered that in
that country wealth is more evenly distributed than it is here. There
are no paupers, and public schools are plentiful. The English, French,
and German languages are taught in most schools, and the Norwegian
bookseller is usually a well-educated man and a product of one of the
public schools.</p>

<p>The following facts are from a summary of an able address given by
Mr. W.H. Arnold before the American Booksellers' Association, and are
well worthy of the study of the publishers and the booksellers in this
country:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Bookselling in Norway is so organized as to eliminate almost all
the risks to which English booksellers are exposed, to secure
satisfactory results for the publishers, and to provide a fair reward
for the author. Three trade organizations are in existence&mdash;The
Publishers' Association, the National Association of Booksellers,
and the Provincial Association of Booksellers, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>qualification
for membership in both the first and the last named being membership
of the National Association. All booksellers must be members of
the National Association. The Provincial Association includes all
booksellers except those in Christiania. There is a National Board of
Directors, composed of members of each association.</p>

<p>An applicant wishing to become a bookseller addresses the National
Board. A young man of eighteen may become a bookseller when he is
thirty; he has twelve years' training&mdash;four years as apprentice,
eight years as assistant. Besides a knowledge of books, he must
give security, and if he can prove he has sufficient funds in hand,
the National Directors will give their permission for his beginning
business on his own account; but the Directors have it in their power
to decide whether a new bookshop is wanted in the district mentioned.</p>

<p>A town of 8,000 people would afford scope for two bookshops. Molde,
familiar to English tourists, with a population of 2,200 has one
thriving bookseller; Aalesund, with a population of 14,000, has three
bookshops, and none of these booksellers need fear the incursion of
other rivals.</p>

<p>The subscription to the National Association is 10 krone&mdash;about
12<i>s.</i>&mdash;per annum; and for the Association's weekly journal, 6<i>s.</i> per
annum is charged. An annual list of publications is issued, and once
in ten years a reference catalogue is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>issued, costing about 20<i>s.</i>
All miscellaneous publications are issued in paper covers, and can
be obtained in cloth, but the paper is the more popular format. The
book buyer who decides that the paper volume is worth preserving, if
so minded gets it bound in cloth or half leather, cloth costing 1<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> and leather 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Retail prices are always net&mdash;there are
no price cutters in Norway.</p>

<p>Publishers do not require to call on the trade: a descriptive circular
is all that is necessary. The bookseller, after reading this, settles
how many copies to buy outright, and additional copies can be had,
subject to return. Prices of fiction range from 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to 4<i>s.</i>
No reduction in the price of a book is allowed until five years after
publication.</p>

<p>Payment for bought books is usually made half yearly, in January
and July, and "on sale" volumes are accounted for in January, the
volumes sold being paid for in March. The usual trade discount is 25
per cent., and when ten copies are bought an extra copy is included.
School-books are always bought outright.</p>

<p>The Provincial Association has a central depot in Christiania, the
stock of which company is owned by the Association members. The
central depot "collects," packs, and dispatches to its members in the
provinces, charging a scheduled rate for this service. Subscription
books are all sold through the book stores, the only books <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>disposed
of outside recognized channels being religious publications handled by
pedlars.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, there can be objections raised to many points in this
organization, but what I wish to point out is, that if an association
can be of great value to the trade in a small community such as Norway,
which experience shows it to be, surely by organizing and blending
the different associations in our trade here, similar results may
follow. Anyway, it can be safely relied upon that something definite
and more workable should take the place of our present half-hearted
and semi-distinct organizations which are supposed to supervise the
workings of the book trade in this country.</p>

<p>There are other questions one might consider. That of the cheap reprint
is often a debatable one, some maintaining that it interferes with the
sales of the more expensive editions; others that it often creates
interest in a particular book, and, through its issue, inquiries are
made for the author's previous books. From some points of view both
these arguments have in them an element of truth, but it all depends
upon the character of the book.</p>

<p>As a rule the life of works of fiction is very short, except in special
cases. The life of works of an author of, say, two or three books,
would probably be about three to six months, so for books in this class
a limit of twelve months should be allowed before a cheap edition is
issued, and according to the popularity of the author, these times
should vary up to two or three years before cheap editions of books
by authors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> of long standing are issued, and also the better edition
should be cleared from the bookseller's shelves before the cheaper
edition is published. From a bookseller's point of view, there is no
language too strong in condemnation of the system now much in vogue,
that a 2<i>s.</i> edition of a 6<i>s.</i> novel may be issued, and both editions
kept in circulation at the same time. Editions selling at various
prices are often sold by the author to different publishers, and each
price is supposed to appeal to a different public. Can a bookseller be
expected to keep a stock of all these editions? If so, his stock of
cheap reprints would demand a special warehouse.</p>

<p>The most reasonable course to pursue in all cheap issues is first to
see if there is a public to which a cheap edition would appeal, settle
a moderate price at which it should be published, allowing a fair
profit to the trade, and after a sufficient time has been given for
the original edition to have a good run, there may be issued the cheap
edition, which, while appealing to a fresh public, will be remunerative
to the author and publisher, and, let us hope, a help to civilization
and the betterment of mankind.</p>

<p>Much the same argument applies to the speculative religious work.
There would not, of course, be so many different editions, but if the
book in its special issue is of a distinctly argumentative character,
and appeals to a thoughtful and intelligent public, a cheap edition
is desirable, not only because it will sell, but because it will make
people think, and truth is generally brought to the surface and put
into operation by a public who thinks.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>I am, therefore, convinced that when due time and consideration have
been given to a book, a cheap edition is often not only advisable, but
necessary.</p>

<p>Another question is, "Should a book be remaindered, and if so, under
what conditions?" This is a very important one, and I am convinced
that no definite rule can be laid down which would be applicable to
all classes of remainders. There are books remaindered which will sell
quickly when brought to the notice of a particular class of readers,
and others which are only fit for the hawker's barrow or to be pulped
as waste. I have known many books which have been remaindered and
have thus had attention drawn to them; occasionally they have been
quickly bought up, and often resold at their full published price. To
instance only one, the first edition of Fitzgerald's "Omar Khayyám"
was sold from a fourpenny box, and copies of this edition afterwards
fetched £25. By this means a reputation was established and a position
for this book secured. I maintain that discretion should be shown in
this as well as in other departments of our trade. There are books
which are only fit to become fuel for the fire, while others, either
through over-printing or want of pushful advertising, have reached
a very limited public, and through the book being reduced in price
it has reached an eager public delighted to get a book of such value
at a price suited to their limited means. Although bookselling is a
business, and a most interesting one, yet it does not exist only for
those who carry it on. If there were no bookseller's shops some means
would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> have to be found for disseminating that which goes to making
the intelligence of a nation. "Show me the literature of a nation, and
I will tell you the character of the people," said a great man, and I
am quite convinced that if limits were placed upon the distribution of
our books for the benefit of author or bookseller, the Government or
the people would soon find some means by which their intellectual wants
were supplied.</p>

<p>My firm conviction is that no book should be destroyed which appeals
to the intellect or which goes to the formation of character. When
the time comes in the life of a book that it has exhausted the sphere
for which it was intended, let it be offered as a remainder, and I
am sure that it will percolate through the various strata of society
until it finds its level of usefulness. This may be in the library of
the collector or in the more useful sphere of the homes of the working
classes, but a book of any literary value should never be destroyed.</p>

<p>In summarizing the various suggestions made in this paper, I would
suggest that the most serious consideration be afforded to the
following important propositions, so that more unity and stability may
be given to the position of the author, publisher, and the various
factors in book-distributing and bookselling.</p>

<p>Firstly, in regard to the author, my contention would be that the first
book by an author, however good from a publisher's point of view it
may be, should be either sent on sale or made returnable, say within
six months. If the book has any literary merit it will be found out
by that time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> and the copies sent but will be sold. If not, they
should be returned, so that the book distributor does not have to
share a loss for which the publisher alone is responsible. The author
should discourage as much as possible the auction-like action of the
literary agent who tries to sell manuscripts to the highest bidder,
thus lowering the tone of the relationship between the author and the
publisher. And I say with all seriousness that should an author have
satisfactory arrangements with a publisher he should stick to him, as I
am sure it is best for both parties that a publisher should be able to
put all the works of an author in his lists, and not only those issued
by himself. By this arrangement a publisher will continue to interest
himself in all the books by an author, and by advertising them will
materially assist in continuous sales.</p>

<p>Secondly, the publisher should discriminate between books in which he
is financially interested, and those which he is publishing to please
the ambition of a person who wishes to see his or her name in print.
He should also fix his terms and stand by them to both the wholesale
and retail trader. These are now fairly carried out by some of the
older-established publishers, but in some of their cheaper issues they
appear to be unable to discriminate between what is a wholesale order
and a wholesale trader.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the question of competition and underselling is still of the
utmost importance, and I fear will never be settled until there is
united action by a joint committee consisting of representatives of
both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> Publishers' and Booksellers' Associations, and all books are
published at a fixed net price. The great objection to this arrangement
is mainly the issue of juvenile and school-books. A margin frequently
is demanded, so that a considerable discount can be given to the
schoolmasters and mistresses or the governing bodies of our various
educational authorities. It is, however, a fair question to ask, "Why
should part of the legitimate profit of the bookseller be taken by the
school representatives?" It is to be hoped that by association and
unity these unsatisfactory anomalies will be swept away. One of the
first subjects these joint associations would have to consider would
be the minimum amount of profit which should be given to the retail
bookseller. This should be, at least, 25 per cent. off the net selling
price, and a further discount to <i>bona fide</i> wholesale and export
booksellers. If all books were made net, and some such discounts as
those mentioned were given, much of the present discontent would be
removed, and, with a living profit assured, there would be a great
inducement for many of the smaller men in the country to interest
themselves in the trade, and thus bring about a renewal of an industry
which should be beneficial both to the industrious bookseller as well
as the intellectual community.

<p class="center">Term and Sale Catalogues</p>


<p class="drop">I<span class="uppercase">n</span> the early seventies, while living at Holloway, it was my good
fortune to meet Mr. Edward Arber, who also dwelt in that district. At
that time he was making the transcript of the Registers at Stationers'
Hall, and also publishing many reprints from Old English literature.
It is to the many interesting conversations which I had with him
while walking to Stationers' Hall Court, as we both at that time did,
that I became more interested in some of the ways of the booksellers
of previous generations, and in the introduction and use of the
Booksellers' Catalogues. From the origin of printing in England in
1472 until 1526, it is quite a question whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> any books which can
be considered English literature were produced and printed in this
country. The books sold here were mostly foreign productions, and, as
numbers of them had an ultra-Romish tendency, it was a sure passport
to a cruel death to possess a copy of many of the books of the period.
Even these were produced in small octavo size, so that they could be
carried in the owner's pocket without discovery.</p>

<p>The earliest register of books published was that by the Company of
Stationers of London which began in 1554. This record was carried on
until 1640, and it is from these catalogues, of which my friend Mr.
Arber devoted the best part of twenty years in producing a transcript,
in five folio volumes, that any bibliographer can now trace the authors
and date of publication of much of the literature of that period.
Following on from the before-mentioned period, there were various
classi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>fied catalogues issued by different publishers, but in 1662-3
there was published a catalogue of books registered at Stationers'
Hall from the 25th of December 1662 to the 25th of December 1663. This
was the first attempt at the yearly issue of a complete list of books
published, and, it is supposed, was brought to an end by the Plague and
the Great Fire of London, which we know from "Pepys's Diary" and other
records caused the destruction of an immense number of books to the
value of some £200,000.</p>

<p>The next important series of Catalogues were "The Term Catalogues
of Books printed in England." These were begun in November 1668 and
ended in June 1709. Their title was evidently taken from a legal
point of view, as they were divided into periods of Michaelmas Term,
Hilary Term, Easter Term and the Trinity Term. The catalogues were
very carefully reproduced in three volumes by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> Mr. Arber, and often
gives me much material for speculative thought and reflection. In an
introductory preface to these Term Catalogues, Mr. Arber writes: "There
is something perfectly God-like in a wide survey for a given period
of the entire literature of a great nation. It is like Moses viewing
from Mount Pisgah the whole of the land of promise, and will help us
to a better understanding of and a greater delight in the ages of the
Restoration of William and Mary and of Queen Anne." These catalogues
were intended to be an annual list of the books entered at Stationers'
Hall, and no London stationer could lawfully publish a book until he
had been made free of this Company.</p>

<p>In looking through the volumes of catalogues above referred to, I have
been greatly interested in the titles of some of these old books.
What food for thought must there have been in some of the following:
"Sober Singularity, or an Antidote against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> Infection by the example
of a Multitude"; "The Arts of Grandeur and Submission, a discourse
concerning the behaviour of great men towards their inferiors"; "A
Mirror or a Looking-glass for Saints and Sinners"; "The Ladies Blush";
"The Citizen turn'd Gentleman"; "Two Bulls roaring out Excommunication"
(the first by Pope Paul III against Henry VIII; the other by Pope Pius
V against Queen Elizabeth); "The Worth of a Penny; with the causes
of the scarcity and the misery of the want thereof, in these hard
and mercyless times"; "A Mirror that Flattereth not"; "A new Map of
the Seat of the War in Germany so designed that you may presently
know whether name of any place be in the map or not, and to see by
inspection the distance of it from any other place without measuring
by compasses"; "A Catholic Pill to purge Popery"; "England's Glory, or
the great improvement of trade in general by a Royal Bank or Office of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Credit to be erected in London, that they may give out bills of credit
to a vast extent that all Europe will accept of rather than money."
By the title it is evident that the finances of this country were as
important to the world then as they are to-day.</p>

<p>This list could be increased to fill a volume of these quaint and
interesting titles. It also contained a list of the publications of
many books, which are popular to-day by great authors such as John
Bunyan, R. Baxter, Milton, Shakespeare, and others. One could not
help noticing the names of some publishers which are well known in
the book trade to-day, such as A. &amp; J. Churchill, Collins, J. Moxon,
Richard Bentley, although of course they are not the successors to
those of the Term Catalogue period. The Catalogue also states that in
1702 the "Daily Courant" was started, being the first daily newspaper
to be published in London. I find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> also in these volumes what I think
is the first notice of the odd copy being given. The advertisement
runs as follows: "Proposals are now published for printing all the
practical works of the late Rev. Mr. Robert Baxter in four volumes and
in folio, many of which he wrote at the desire of Archbishop Ussher. To
contain one thousand sheets of a large and very good paper, the price
to subscribers four pounds, ten shillings in quires, the seventh book
gratis, which reduces it to £3 12<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> The proposals at large may
be had of the Undertakers, Thomas Parkinson and others." Ever since
this period, the giving of the odd copy has been frequently discussed,
but it appears quite possible that by the introduction of the net
system it has received a very serious stoppage which may lead to its
final abolition.</p>

<p>The earliest book auction sale recorded took place at Warwick
Court, Warwick Lane, in 1676, and in the following ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> years only
seventy-three auction sales of books are recorded as having been held.
These auctions usually began at nine in the morning, and biddings
might advance at a penny per time. The sales, however, differed from
the sales of a later period. Formerly at the sales I attended the lots
of books fell to the highest bidder, but although an auctioneer was
usually present, he could only sell by a scale according to numbers,
which was arranged by the publisher for whom the auctioneer acted.
These delightful old catalogues are a continual source of inspiration
to all booksellers, even if it is only the author or title of a book in
which he is interested.</p>

<p>It is, however, the sale catalogues of the eighteenth and the greater
part of the nineteenth century which interest me most. It was a period
which may be called the Golden Age of bookselling. The sale catalogues
of this later time unfortunately came to an end in 1890, with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
of Richard Bentley &amp; Son, whose business was afterwards taken over by
Messrs. Macmillan &amp; Co. At the end of this catalogue, dated October 21,
1890, there was reprinted from "The Bookseller" an article on "Trade
Sale Dinners," to which I contributed some of the information, and I am
indebted to the courteous head of Messrs. Whitaker &amp; Co. for allowing
me to reproduce it in this chapter. It is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The very ancient institution, peculiar to booksellers, of dining
together on the occasion of a trade sale, is almost extinct and is, we
very much regret to think, likely to become entirely so in the near
future.</p>

<p>"The fashion of dining together on the occasion of a sale is a
very old one. An interesting collection of sale catalogues in the
possession of Mr. William Reader contains specimens dating back to
1704. They consist of the catalogues sent in the ordinary course of
business to Osborne and his successor, the first of the Longmans.
It is evident from these catalogues that sale dinners were a
well-established custom of the trade as long ago as the beginning of
the eighteenth century; and, as it must have required considerable
time for the practice to have developed into a custom, their first
beginnings may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> possibly have been as far back as 'the spacious times
of great Elizabeth,' when bookselling first took shape as a regular
trade.</p>

<p>"The first catalogue in Mr. Reader's collection is that of the stock
of Mrs. Elizabeth Harris, deceased, which is to be sold at 'The Bear,
in Avey Mary Lane,' on the 11th December, 1704, 'beginning at 9 in the
morning, when the whole company shall be entertained with a breakfast,
and at noon with a good dinner and a glass of wine, and then proceed
with the sale in order to finish that evening.' The sale of the stock
of the late John Nicholson took place in 1718 at the Queen's Head
Tavern in Paternoster Row, and the catalogue bears marginal notes in
Osborne's handwriting, the names of Curil and Tonson appearing amongst
the buyers. Nicholson's interest in certain share books was also
disposed of, including Robert Clavel's shares, which he had formerly
acquired. (Robert Clavel was a bookseller who flourished during the
latter half of the previous century. He carried on business at the
Peacock, in St. Paul's Churchyard, and in 1673 issued the well-known
'Catalogue of all the Books Printed in England since the Dreadful Fire
of London in 1666 to the end of Michaelmas Term, 1672.') Nicholson's
stock and shares appeared to have realized altogether £2,533, a very
respectable sum for those days.</p>

<p>"It is remarkable that these sale catalogues were printed in almost
exactly the same form as those of our own day. Nearly all are in
folio, with broad margins for annotations, and they are addressed
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> 'A select number of Booksellers of London and Westminster,' in
the identical terms still current. Only those who were invited by
having a catalogue sent them were expected to attend the sale, and the
invitations were restricted to booksellers of established position.
'No stallmen admitted' is the significant notice printed at the head
of one of the catalogues.</p>

<p>"It was not always a dinner that was given; sometimes it was a supper
at which the buyers were entertained, as at the sale of Edward
Valentine's stock in 1725, on the margin of which catalogue we
first meet with the name of Longman among the buyers. In any case,
however, whether the stock sold was that of an individual bookseller
or a miscellaneous assortment from several contributors, it was the
invariable custom to entertain those who came with a substantial
repast 'and a glass of good wine.' At Thomas Osborne's sale in 1743,
the catalogue even recites the delicacies which were provided,
'consisting of turkies and chines, hams and chickens, apple-pies,
etc., and a glass of very good wine.'</p>

<p>"Thirteen years later, in 1756, the sale took place of part of the
stock of the late Thomas Longman, Osborne's successor and founder
of the great Paternoster Row house. The copyrights and shares of
Jacob and Richard Tonson were sold in August, 1767, and we notice
the names of Dilly, Rivington, and Newbery amongst the buyers. Many
of the copyrights were offered in twentieths, for the convenience of
bidders. At that time, and long afterward, the risk and expense of
publishing a book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> were jointly borne by a group of booksellers, who
met periodically to agree upon the number to be printed, and to audit
accounts, and these shares constantly appear in the sale catalogues of
the period.</p>

<p>"The trade sales were always held at some selected tavern or
coffee-house; until 1754, they took place at the Queen's Head Tavern
in Paternoster Row, and up to that time it is a rare exception to find
them held elsewhere. But in 1755 they were removed to the Queen's Arms
in St. Paul's Churchyard, in consequence, as a note on a catalogue
of that date states, of the Queen's Head Tavern being converted to
another use. For many years subsequently the Queen's Arms continued
in favour, and sales were held there as late as 1813; but from about
1790 the London Coffee House on Ludgate Hill seems to have had the
preference. The Horn Tavern, Doctors' Commons, was sometimes selected,
and less frequently the Globe Tavern, in Fleet Street, where as long
ago as 1768, a sale was held. The Chapter Coffee House in Paternoster
Row was sometimes used, but not often, although the share-meetings
continued to take place there until a very recent date. The London
Coffee House gradually obtained a monopoly of the trade sales, until
they were finally transferred to the Albion Tavern in Aldersgate
Street.</p>

<p>"During a period of nearly a hundred and ninety years the sales appear
to have been almost exclusively held at five houses, which, as time
went on, succeeded each other in favour. The transfer to the Albion
was gradual, but in 1831 the greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> number were already held there,
and in recent years seldom took place elsewhere, though occasionally
one was held as far west as the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen
Street.</p>

<p>"Within the present generation, the houses having annual sale dinners
numbered about fourteen&mdash;Bentley, Bickers, Bohn, Chatto &amp; Windus,
Longmans, Macmillan, Murray, Quaritch, Routledge, Seeley and Burnside,
Tegg, Ward and Lock, Warne, and Whittaker; and of these only two now
survive. Messrs. Longmans' last sale dinner took place on November 5,
1872, and Mr. Murray's last dinner on November 4, 1887.</p>

<p>"It is curious that the form of trade sale catalogues should have
remained so long unchanged. The old-fashioned yellow-wove post
folios of Murray are well remembered. Those of Bentley are somewhat
different. Their catalogues were printed in red and black for some
years, but since 1885 in blue and brown; and, with a single exception,
in 1880, their dinners always took place at the Albion."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was in connexion with the firm with which I have been for so many
years associated, that I happened, quite accidentally, some thirty
years ago, to come across a parcel of catalogues which were placed
with a heap of papers to be sent to the paper mills for destruction.
My interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> in them was such that as they were considered only
waste paper, I took the bundle home, and they have since been to
me an endless source of pleasure and instruction. Some of these
catalogues are dated 1797, but from the early part of the nineteenth
century, judging from the catalogues, books and booksellers had a
very prosperous period. At this time, the following publishers and
booksellers had a large number of titles in their catalogues, and
in many instances they were very important publications. Among them
are Sir Richard Phillips (Lord Mayor of London), Darton &amp; Harvey (10
Crosby Square), Joseph Johnson, J. Walker, F. &amp; C. Rivington, Murray
&amp; Highley (the predecessors of the celebrated house of John Murray),
Longman, Hurst Rees &amp; Orme (who at this period had a very miscellaneous
catalogue of books, including plays), Wilson &amp; Spence of York, Henry
Mozley of Gainsborough, Cadell &amp; Davies, J. Stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>dale of Piccadilly,
Scotcherd &amp; Letterman, W. Miller, C. Law, Constable, Vernor &amp; Hood, G.
&amp; J. Robinson, and R. Baldwin. Most of these catalogues contain books
which had been issued by a combination of bookseller publishers; the
shares in the publication of a particular book were divided up by those
interested in the book; and the profits were divided between those who
contributed to its publication.</p>

<p>A catalogue, dated April 1805, of Joseph Maurnan, agent to the
University of Cambridge, besides enumerating Bibles of various sizes,
from folio to twelves and twenty-fours, and Common Prayers of a like
character (these were sold 5 for 4, 9 for 7, 12 for 10, and other
numbers with a similar reduction), also contained such books as "Lambe
on Constitutional Diseases"; Ruddiman's "Rudiments," new edition;
Ruffhead's "Statutes," 18 vols., £38; New Geographical Game upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> cards
in a box, 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; also a collection of Plays and Farces.</p>

<p>Another catalogue, dated June 1805, shows that at this period women
held a position amongst the booksellers. This catalogue was issued
by Elizabeth Mathews, 18 Strand, and the terms of the sale were four
months' credit for £10; four and eight months' for £20; four, eight,
and twelve months' for £50; four, eight, twelve, and sixteen for £100:
money was evidently not of the same value then as now. Some of the most
important books in this catalogue were "Annual Register," 33 vols.;
Buffon's "Natural History," 15 vols.; Sheraton's "Cabinet Maker's
Drawing Book," 18<i>s.</i>; "Encyclopædia Britannica," 20 vols. Another of
the same period also contained many important works such as "Johnson's
Dictionary," in 4 vols., Mavor's "Voyages and Travels," 25 vols.,
Radcliffe's "Mysteries of Udolpho," 4 vols.; "Pinder's Works," 5 vols.;
Pope's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> "Homer," 5 vols. "Shakespeare's Works," in 21 vols., and with
four different editions in 10 vols. and two in 9 vols., are all in this
catalogue. From this period onward the same characteristics appear in
catalogues, but by degrees, when publishers only sold the books they
published, the constitution of the catalogue and the sales greatly
changed and the business done was more ordinary and commonplace. I have
spent many most enjoyable occasions when attending these sales, and
also met there many distinguished people connected both with the trade
and also with the making of literature.</p>

<p>As a few samples of the characteristics and the business done at
some of the sale dinners when the custom was drawing to a close, I
may mention that at Murray's sale, in 1885, the completing volume
of the "Speaker's Commentary" was among the works offered, and some
2,500 copies were sold within the first ten minutes; of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> great
traveller Du Chaillu's "Land of the Midnight Sun," in 2 vols., about
1,800 copies were sold. The educational works of Dr. Smith were then in
great demand, and there were disposed of at this sale some 7,500 copies
of his "English Course," and of the Latin 16,000, while of "Little
Arthur's History of England," 12,500 copies were sold.</p>

<p>At another sale, when Bishop Wilberforce's Life was the leading book
offered, the principal sales were as follows: 1,000 Mudie's Library,
900 Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co., 450 Hamilton &amp; Co., 250 Smith &amp; Son, 100
W. Kent, and 100 Hatchard's, whilst 22,500 of Smith's Latin Course were
quickly purchased.</p>

<p>Times and the methods of education have greatly changed, but there
are two things respecting these sales which strike me very forcibly.
These are the comparatively small sales to-day of the above-mentioned
educational works, also whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> the publisher has been wise to stop
these trade sales. They undoubtedly not only brought publishers and
booksellers together, but offered an inducement to the booksellers
which does not exist to the same extent to-day to make up stock orders
and interest themselves in books.</p>

<p>Personally, as I have suggested in other chapters, I should be
delighted to see some organized association brought into existence of
which all those interested in the making and selling of books could
become members, so that representatives of the different departments
of the trade might meet together and talk over or discuss questions
connected with it. This I am sure would lead to a greater and more
satisfactory prosperity in all departments of the publishers' and
booksellers' trade than has ever yet been attained.</p>

<p class="ph2"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></p>

<p class="center">Limited Editions and the Pleasures of Collecting</p>


<p class="drop">I<span class="uppercase">t</span> would be quite impossible within the limits of a short chapter to
deal with such a great subject as the above title represents. The
subject, however, is fascinating not only to the book collector but to
those in the trade, both new and second-hand, through whose hands the
books pass.</p>

<p>Until the introduction of printing, what may be termed books or
literature were all limited editions, as in olden times it was only
by the industry of the scribes that other copies could be produced.
Privately printed originally meant printed in a university or private
residence and not in the offices of an ordinary printer. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> however,
privately printed and limited editions have each much the same meaning,
as they are both practically limited in the numbers printed.</p>

<p>I must confess that I have a profound sympathy with all collectors
of this particular class of book-producing, for it is with great
pride that one takes down from the shelves a volume of this class
of literature and reads how many copies of it were printed, and any
history that may be connected with it. This attraction is from my
point of view as far apart as the poles from that of collecting works
produced before the origin of printing or even those in the centuries
afterwards, where frequently the mistakes in printing make the value of
the book. Such, for instance, as that of the Bible where the word "not"
is left out in one of the commandments, or where a chance misprint or
mistake is noted in some of Shakespeare's or other Elizabethan plays. A
long list could easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> be made of the small things that render some of
these ancient volumes valuable.</p>

<p>To-day, these limited editions are produced in the most careful,
complete, and perfect manner possible. From a real book-lover's point
of view, the beauty of the type, the excellency of the paper and the
artistic merit of its binding, coupled with the literary value of the
book itself, make a volume which one is proud to possess and have upon
one's shelves. For some years past there has been a considerable demand
for the limited issue of well-illustrated books numbered and signed by
such artists as Rackham, Dulac, and others; these are widely sought
after and collected; so also are those works issued by private presses
of which the past fifty years has seen some splendid developments.
Take, for instance, the Ashenden Press, with its beautiful edition of
Dante; the Kelmscott Press, under the guidance of William Morris, which
issued many of his own books (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> wood-blocks of his works are now in
the keeping of the British Museum, with whom they were deposited on
the understanding that no one is to be at liberty to print from them
for a hundred years); the Vale Press, which limited its editions to
200 copies; the Cardoc Press; the Eragny Press; the Essex House Press;
the Dove Press, which finished its course in 1917 by the type being
"cast" into the Thames and "distributed" at the bottom of the river;
and Mr. Daniel's Press at Oxford. Although these various presses appeal
to the collector, first editions and rare books have a greater number
of collectors, whose lives are frequently passed in hunting after and
trying to discover and secure lost old volumes.</p>

<p>This pleasurable following to-day has not the advantages that
existed in the middle of the past century, as not only are there
now more seekers after these treasures of the past, but America has
so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> many collectors of old books that the demand is greater and the
prices higher. These drawbacks will greatly interfere with both the
business and the enjoyment of future collectors. The chances, too,
of the old-book collector are not nearly so great as formerly, for
the changes which have taken place, particularly in London, have
certainly swept away many of their favourite haunts. It is to many a
very great pleasure to look back in memory upon old Holywell Street,
with its scores of book-hunters turning over the boxes and seeking
for treasures. Mr. W.E. Gladstone and many dignitaries of the Church
could often be seen there. Fleet Street, the Strand, Holborn, and many
of the by-streets between Oxford Street and Trafalgar Square, were
great thoroughfares for the book-hunter; and although the barrows of
Farringdon Street are still in existence, either the bookstall man now
knows his business better than his predecessor or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> the gems are sold
before he places these precious books on his barrow. Many times I have
turned over the stock of old books on these Farringdon Street barrows,
but have never yet been able to find anything of value, although others
have been more fortunate. We have now no such opportunities as those of
Charles Lamb; and I cannot say if we would avail ourselves of them even
if we had. Lamb writes (March 25, 1829):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have just come from town where I have been to get my bit of
quarterly pension. I have brought home from stalls in Barbican the old
'Pilgrims Progress' with the prints Vanity Fair, etc., now scarce,
four shillings, cheap. And also one of whom I have oft heard and had
dreams, but never saw it in the flesh&mdash;that is in sheep-skin&mdash;'The
whole Theological works of Thomas Aquinas.' My arms ached with lugging
it a mile to the stage, but the burden was a pleasure."</p></blockquote>

<p>All lovers of books must at some time feel the fascination of the
second-hand bookseller's shop, and especially when it has a "Tuppenny
Box" attached to it. At such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> shops, you may examine every book in
the place, read a little, look at the pictures and the binding, have
a gossip with the intelligent bookseller, and never be asked to spend
a penny. The keeper of such books usually knows his business and the
origin and history of much of his stock, and is able to tell some good
bookish stories in keeping with his profession. A true lover of books
thinks little of their monetary value but treasures a volume because of
its contents, or perhaps for some association or memory connected with
the author.</p>

<p>One cannot get away from the feeling, when surrounded by old books,
that there is probably some unsuspected treasure hidden among the
volumes handled with so much pleasure. What a thrill would pass through
you if you discovered one of Shakespeare's original plays or some other
of the many precious dramas of the Elizabethan age. Or a first edition
of Scott, Lamb, Burns, Blake, or even one of Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> Watts' Divine Songs
containing "Let dogs delight to bark and bite," a copy of which was
sold for £155. It is said that the bibliomaniac fever generally begins
at the bookstall. Of all kinds of human weakness, the craze for buying
and collecting old books is the most excusable. In the early phases
of this complaint, the book-lover is content to purchase only books
which he reads; next, he buys books which he means to read, and, as
his stores accumulate, hopes to read; by and by he takes home books in
beautiful bindings, or artistic illustrations, or of an early date, and
sometimes printed in a language which he cannot read. Once a lover,
always a lover, is a true saying, particularly when applied to a lover
of books. As old age draws near, the lover of books finds a solace
and joy in the companionship of his silent friends, which not only
increases as the years pass on but undoubtedly helps to maintain his
interest in life. He may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> retire from active business at any time, and
still in his retirement be as happy and contented as at any period of
his more strenuous days.</p>

<p>In my own case many of these ideals have been realized. Numberless
volumes have been written on the pleasures of book-hunting and its
results. Some glory in their collection of books upon certain subjects,
such as Angling and all other kinds of sport; some have libraries
on Philosophy, History, Biography, Architecture, and other branches
of intellectual study; others collect fiction and first editions of
celebrated authors, many of which have only a fleeting value. In
whatever way we regard book-collecting, there can be no doubt that
if carried through from an intellectual point of view, there are few
things in life which are so rich in quiet satisfaction or which give
such gratifying results to both mind and body.</p>

<p>It has been well said by Mr. J.A. Lang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>ford in his interesting volume
entitled "The Praise of Books": "A wise man will select his books, for
he would not wish to class them all under the sacred name of friends.
Some can be accepted only as acquaintances. The best books of all kinds
are taken to the heart and cherished as his most precious possession.
Others to be chatted with for a time, to spend a few pleasant hours
with, and laid aside, but not forgotten."</p>

<p>Such are some of the pleasures and the profits to be derived from
collecting, be it first editions, scarce books, or limited editions.</p>

<p class="center">The Whitefriars Club</p>


<p class="drop">O<span class="uppercase">f</span> all the institutions with which I have been associated, not one has
given me so much pleasure, or of which I feel so proud in belonging
to, as The Whitefriars Club. This Club was founded in 1865, and is
a survival of the old Bohemian life of London; it knows no sect or
politics, and its ambition is to create true fellowship amongst its
members.</p>

<p>The Club has a room and meets at Anderton's Hotel in that highway of
letters, Fleet Street. During the autumn and winter months it has
always been their custom to hold meetings each Friday to hear an
address from some distinguished publicist upon a subject of common
interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> and importance. After the introductory speech by the guest
of the evening, the subject is open to discussion, and each member is
invited to express his views and convictions as freely as possible.
While listening to these speeches, I have often wished that reporters
had been allowed to be present, as I am sure those connected with
newspapers would have found these debates of more interest than
those taking place in a building of a greater national importance.
During the temporary retirement of our present excellent secretary,
Mr. W.N. Shansfield, I had the honour and pleasure of acting as the
Club's secretary for three years. At the end of my term of office, I
was delighted to receive a beautiful pair of candelabra as a present
from the Club, the greatly revered Lord Roberts being the guest of
the evening on this occasion. I can safely say that this presentation
was one of the most interesting events in my life, as after it had
been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> made, Lord Roberts rose from his seat, came round to me, shook
hands, and uttered some pleasant words of congratulation. To me the
occasion was a memorable one. There are, however, so many interesting
associations connected with this Club that I must go back to 1901, the
year of my becoming a member.</p>

<p>At the time of my joining the Hon. Secretary was Sir Arthur Spurgeon,
who has always been most loyal and helpful to members of the Club, and
to whom every one is deeply indebted for the interest and support he
has given to it. He it was who helped to develop the Club and made it
one of the great centres of journalistic and literary London. The Club
can never have a better or more thorough and efficient officer than the
present secretary, my good friend, Mr. W.N. Shansfield. He is always
at his post, and by his many amiable qualities greatly stimulates and
carries on the friendly intercourse at which the Club<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> aims. Every
member of the Club is entitled to the distinction of being a Friar,
and the one who presides at our festivities is for the evening the
Prior, so that discipline and order among the Brotherhood is a foregone
conclusion.</p>

<p>The following toast is always given at each meeting by the Prior and
is heartily responded to by the Friars and guests present: "Friars and
Guests,&mdash;By this wine we commemorate the White Friars of old, fortified
with spirit&mdash;the spirit of admiration for their services to charity
and good learning&mdash;and sweetened by sympathy for those who, broken by
fortune, dwell in Alsatia. It is left for me, as Prior of the day, to
add the cordial&mdash;a cordial welcome to the guests of the Brotherhood
assembled at our board. Gentlemen, I bid a hearty welcome to you
all, and invite you to join with the Brothers of a gracious order in
drinking to the prosperity of the Whitefriars Club."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the Priors who have presided at our gatherings memory calls
up many who were leaders in the world of Literature and Journalism,
such as William Senior, Richard Whiteing, G. Manville Fenn, Sir F.
Carruthers Gould, Sir J. Foster Fraser, Sir Arthur Spurgeon, Sir
Anthony Hope, G.B. Burgin (who also edits "The Whitefriars Journal"),
Edward Clodd, Clement K. Shorter, Sir W. Robertson Nicoll and Sir
William Treloar, who have all distinguished themselves by their
aptitude and eloquence. It would be a breach of the rules of our
Order to give any account of the various nobles and gentlemen who
have honoured the Club by their presence. Sufficient to say that, be
the invited guest ever so exalted, the Club's invitation is seldom
declined. Many times I have heard from a guest what a delightful
evening he has spent and the enjoyment he has experienced in the good
fellowship which dominates the members and the proceedings of the Club.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>On two occasions during the year, we have what is termed "Ladies'
Nights." This may appear strange to those who think that the monastic
order is carried out in its entirety, but I am sure the evening is
always as enjoyable to the ladies as it is to the Friars. On these
occasions, we have the toast of "Mere Man," proposed by a lady, and, as
a set off, the toast of "Sov'ram Woman," of course proposed by a Friar;
and each is equally appreciated. A volume which would be of great
interest to the public generally, might easily be compiled of extracts
from the Journals of the Club, but as it is understood by the members
that no reporters are present at our meetings, and that the proceedings
are for the members only and that no publicity is given to them, I must
not depart from this order of secrecy.</p>

<p>One of my early associations with the Club was on the visit of Mark
Twain to this country. He was invited to accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> some of the
members to Lambeth Palace, to hear an address from the Librarian upon
the many beautiful MSS. which the Library contained. This was most
interesting, as was also the visit to the Lollards' Tower, with its
many religious associations. After our visit to the Palace we were
invited to take tea, if I remember rightly, at the Authors' Club. Here
a number of notable authors and others were assembled to welcome the
American guest, among them being Dr. Stubbs, Bishop of Oxford, and
Canon Barnett. I was one of a group who were narrating some of their
interesting experiences, when the Rev. Canon told a story which greatly
amused his hearers and especially the members of our Club. The story
caused shouts of laughter and the Bishop held up his hands in apparent
surprise, and made some remark respecting it. I happened to suggest
that the rev. gentleman should be called to order by the Bishop, but he
again held up his hands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> said, "Not in my Diocese," a retort which
caused more laughter than the story.</p>

<p>There is one association in connexion with the Whitefriars Club which
I shall not be breaking their rules by mentioning. This is our "Summer
Outing" in June or July, to which ladies were always invited. One
of these "Outings"&mdash;and certainly to me the one in which I found my
greatest anticipations realized&mdash;was that made to the home of our great
novelist, George Meredith, in 1902. I give, therefore, the following
sketch from notes made by myself and a small extract from the Club's
Journal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was on a cloudy, windy, but exhilarating day that a company of
"Whitefriars" started on a pilgrimage to Burford Bridge and Box Hill to
visit one of England's greatest novelists, George Meredith. The railway
journey proved far too short, as we spent the time in discussing with
some of our gifted fellow-travellers questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> social and political,
one topic being "Would England become peopled by an effeminate race
should it cease to foster a jingo or warlike spirit." Needless to say,
no final discussion upon this stupendous subject was reached before
arriving at our destination. At Burford Bridge a capital lunch had
been provided, after which the Prior for the day, Mr. Robert Leighton,
proposed the health of Friar George Meredith. Other toasts were
proposed or responded to by Madam Sarah Grand, Mr. T.P. O'Connor, M.P.,
and Friar Sir Arthur Spurgeon.</p>

<p>After luncheon, a short walk over one of Surrey's most beautiful
hills brought us to the haven of our desires. Here, nestled under
the shade of hill and foliage, stood Flint Cottage, the charming but
unpretentious residence of Friar George Meredith.</p>

<p>Above the house stands the Châlet, the workshop of the great novelist,
eloquent in its stillness and solitude. In this Châlet many of his
masterpieces have been written.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>Every one at some period in their lives has probably experienced that
extreme tension of feelings when they are about to realize that which
a vivid imagination has created and built up until it has become a
veritable brain picture.</p>

<p>We entered the grounds surrounding Flint Cottage, passing in single
file along the paths of a well-kept garden to a rustic seat in a small
meadow-like enclosure where the great novelist sat. With a hearty
shake of the hand as each visitor was introduced and a cheery word of
greeting to many an old friend, we passed before our host, then stood
about in groups or sat buoyantly expectant of what was to follow.</p>

<p>While waiting for the sound of a voice that will never be forgotten,
time was given to reflect upon our first impression of the man whose
name is honoured wherever English literature is known or read. To
the mind which admires all that is great in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> the world of reality or
imagination, it almost savours of sacrilege to attempt to describe
or analyse that which one looks up to and venerates. It is therefore
with the greatest humility that reference is here made to that lofty
embodied intelligence which until then had been known only through the
medium of George Meredith's writings.</p>

<p>Judging from appearances, the world-renowned novelist was quite an
ordinary-looking man of between sixty and seventy years of age. He was
dressed in a dark blue holiday suit, with a red tie, and held a grey
wideawake hat in his hand. His white but luxuriant hair partly covered
a high and noble forehead, which indexed a striking and characteristic
personality. All these details, however, were the outside man. It was
when he began to talk that our attention became riveted, for in the
deep resonant flexibility of his voice one became almost electrified.
Its penetration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> as it conveyed the measured periods of the speaker,
immediately attracted attention, and a hush of expectancy stole over
the listening company. Early in the proceedings, Prior Robert Leighton
read the following address:</p>

<p>"Friar George Meredith,&mdash;We, members of the Whitefriars Club and our
friends, are gratefully conscious of the honour you accord to us in
permitting us a second time to call upon you here at your home. Be
assured we come to you to-day not with any feeling approaching vulgar
curiosity to invade and peep within the sanctities of your chosen
seclusion. We come with the reverence of pilgrims journeying to a
hallowed shrine; content if you do but allow us to enter at your gates
to offer you our respectful homage, to take your hand and listen for
some moments to the living voice of one to whom we individually and the
world in general owe so much.</p>

<p>"The work that you have done has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> become a part of English life and of
our own personal lives. It represents the highest blossom of the tree
of civilization, and it has come to mean so much that to-day no man or
woman can attain to a maturity of culture without having absorbed your
teaching and your spirit. You have taught us to appreciate everything
that is good in life, enhancing its sparkle and flavour. You have
sharpened our wits, polished our manners, advanced our happiness by
widening our comprehension. You have given us a new perception of the
social structure, and especially have you given us a key to the maze
and mystery of women's souls.</p>

<p>"You yourself, sir, in your splendid solitude, can hardly apprehend
what the name of George Meredith means to the best intelligences
of your era. It is a name honoured and venerated above all titles,
signifying to us, your disciples, the sum of all your imaginative
genius and your noble example have conferred. We, men and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> women
alike, who are privileged to see you to-day, are sensible of the added
understanding which comes of personal association with you, and we
shall remember the privilege as one of the most cherished benefits of
our lives."</p>

<p>Friar George Meredith said: "I cannot rise, but I wish to speak and
say: Ladies and Gentlemen, after a shower of honey from the busiest
bees of the bees around me, my wings are clogged, and I cannot fly. I
have no words to thank you. But look at the tops of those trees: from
that short height the measure of us is seen to be pretty equal. Each
does his work in his own way. I find so many people in different walks
that can do what I cannot do. Respect is a very great thing, but I
think we are in the habit of falling into a kind of delirium in regard
to men who after seventy years or more have made a name. We take them
as brandy&mdash;(laughter)&mdash;it is better to make a kind of dilution, and
therefore I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> mix a considerable amount of water with your compliments.
(Laughter.) However, I thank you heartily for coming to see me. If I
had the eloquence of that true Irishman, Mr. T.P. O'Connor, I should be
making an impression now&mdash;(laughter)&mdash;but I am only half Irish&mdash;half
Irish and half Welsh&mdash;I halt therefore rather on one leg. The Welsh are
admirable singers, but bad dancers. Mr. O'Connor would say not only the
words most appropriate, but his language would flow on, and you would
not be able to stop him. (Laughter.) I have not that gift, I can only
thank you for your kindness. (Loud applause.)"</p>

<p>Some of the visitors left their host to visit the Châlet, which,
judging from its dusty appearance, now rarely received a visit from
its master. This literary workshop consists of two rooms, one for
work and the other for rest and refreshment. The former contained a
well-selected library of English and foreign books, all exhibiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the appearance of having been well used. Brockhaus's Great Lexicon
was a prominent feature in the library, which also contained first
editions of several of Meredith's own books and various autograph
presentation works from some of his literary friends. On the writing
table there were many well-used quill pens and scraps of MS., which to
the relic hunter were objects of great temptation, but reverence forbad
sacrilege. Through fear of our tiring a body which Nature has made far
too weak for such a mind, the pilgrimage had to be brought to an early
close, so with minds stimulated and trying to hold some of the wise
thoughts and expressions which had fallen from the great novelist's
lips, we returned to our hotel.</p>

<p>After the tea provided by our always practical secretary, a few short
and thoughtful speeches were delivered by the Prior, Sir William
Treloar and the Rev. W.J. Dawson; then, with cordial farewells and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
those pleasing amenities which help so much in making such outings as
these doubly enjoyable, we journeyed back to the station and to town.
So ended what to others beside myself will always be remembered as one
of the red-letter days of our lives.</p>

<p>Another delightful outing was to Colchester and Constable's country.
There, we were not entertained with "Oysters and Erings Roots," but
with the historical memorials for which this town and district are
famous. After going over the Abbey, the Town Hall, and admiring the
four bronze Ravens which are supposed to be relics of the tenth
century, we drove through the Constable country, visiting "The Vale of
Dedham," passing the Elizabethan Grammar School where John Constable
was educated, "Willy Lotts House" and "Flatford Mill." During another
summer, our journey was to the Dickens country. After alighting at Sole
Street station and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> visiting the Leather Bottle, with its numerous
Dickens relics, and Cobham Church, we drove to Rochester and lunched at
the celebrated Bull Hotel, so humorously associated with Mr. Winkle.
Later on in the day we visited the Cathedral and Dean Hole's delightful
garden of roses.</p>

<p>The House of the Seven Poor Travellers fascinated us greatly, as here
we were shown Dickens' signature when he spent the night getting
material for his Christmas story of the "Seven Poor Travellers." We
also inspected the outbuildings in which he and the other travellers
slept. Among other journeys of very great interest, was one by train
to Oxford and from thence by boat up the Thames to Goring: the scenery
through which we passed is well known for its bewildering beauty.</p>

<p>Most interesting to me, as I happened to be at the time the Hon.
Secretary, was our pilgrimage to Hatfield House. Upon arriving at
Hatfield House and being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> received with a kindly shake of the hand by
the Countess of Salisbury, she showed us through the rooms in which
are located many wonderful historical treasures. More especially to be
admired was the collection of arms, many of which had been captured
from the Spanish Armada. The great library and the wonderful pictures
by Holbein, Van Dyck, Reynolds, and others, fascinated us all, but
perhaps the most interesting were the various relics connected with
Queen Elizabeth: the oak-tree under which she was seated when the news
came of Queen Mary's death and of her own accession to the throne; the
cradle once occupied by Elizabeth; and a pair of her silk stockings,
and a garden bonnet which she wore when walking in the surrounding
woods.</p>

<p>On leaving Hatfield House we drove over to St. Albans, where we visited
the old and delightful Cathedral, rich in its historical associations,
and, after an enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>able dinner at one of the hotels, returned home
with minds full of the events which have helped to make the greatness
of England.</p>

<p>I might mention other delightful "outings" and events, but those which
I have given show the many fascinating episodes associated with the
Whitefriars Club.</p>
